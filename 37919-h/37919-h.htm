<h3>I</h3>

<p>It seems strangely like old times to me to be making these jottings in
Pitman's shorthand. I was surprised to find I remembered as much of it
as I do, for I dropped it suddenly when Archie Merridew died, and
Archie's clear, high-pitched voice was the last that ever dictated to
me for speed, while I myself have not dictated since Archie took down
his last message from my reading. That will be&mdash;say a dozen years or
more ago next August. It may be a little more, or a little less. Nor,
since I do not keep it as an anniversary, does the day of the month
matter.</p>

<p>Either in my rooms or his, we had a good deal of this sort of practise
together about that time, young Archie and I&mdash;reading aloud, taking
down and transcribing. I am wrong in speaking of my "rooms" though; I
had only one, a third-floor bedroom near the very noisiest corner of
King's Cross. It was just opposite one of these running electric
advertisements that changed from green to red and from red to green
three times every minute; you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> know them; there are plenty of them
now, but they were new then. The street was narrow; this horrible
thing was at a rounded corner not more than five and twenty yards
away; and even when my lamp was lighted it still tinged my ceiling and
the upper part of the wall above my bed, red and green, red and
green&mdash;for I had only a little muslin, half-curtain and no blind, and
if I wanted to read in bed I had either to turn my lamp out until I
had undressed or else to undress in a corner by the window side of the
room, because of being overlooked from across the way. I don't think
there were any other lodgers in the house. It was a "pub," the
"Coburg," but I could get on to the staircase without going through
the bars on the ground floor, and always did so. The rather sour smell
of these lower parts of my abode reached me up my three flights of
stairs, but I had got used to that. It was the noise that was the
worst (except, of course, that red and green fiend of an
advertisement)&mdash;the noise that greeted me when I woke of a morning,
awaited me when I came back from Rixon Tebb &amp; Masters' at night, and
often became maddening when, at half-past twelve, they clashed to the
iron gates of the public-house and turned the topers out into the
street, to fraternise or quarrel for half-an-hour or more beneath my
window.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>But we worked more in Archie Merridew's rooms than in mine. "Rooms" is
correct here. He had the whole top floor of a house near the Foundling
Hospital, a pretty house with a fan-lighted ivy-green door, early
Georgian, a brightly twinkling brass knocker and bellpulls, and a
white-washed area inside the railings to make the basement lighter.
His folks lived at Guildford; his father paid his rent for him,
thirty-eight pounds a year; and his pleasant quarters under the roof
had everything that mine hadn't&mdash;he could sit outside on the coped
leads when the weather was hot, draw up cosily to a fireplace shaped
something like a Queen Anne teapot when it was cold, and the ceiling,
truncated along one side, didn't begin to turn red and green the
moment the twilight came.</p>

<p>It gives me a shiver to think how atrociously poor I was in those
days. More and more of that too comes back with the half-forgotten
shorthand. I don't mean that I've ever forgotten that I used to be
poor; it's the depth and degradation I mean and that&mdash;this will seem
odd to you presently, as it seems suddenly odd to me as I write
it&mdash;that memory is still more horrible to me than anything else I have
ever known. My having got rich since doesn't wipe it out. If I were to
become as rich as Rockefeller I should never forget the rages of envy,
black and deep and bitter, that used sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> to take me when I
thought of Archie Merridew's circumstances and my own.</p>

<p>I have got riches as I have got everything else&mdash;<i>everything</i>&mdash;I ever
wanted, by attention to detail. You'll probably agree with me
by-and-by that by "attention to detail" I mean rather more than most
men do when they give this advice to young men about to start in life.
I remember they used to give us, as it were, the empty form and shell
of this maxim at the Business College, the place in Holborn Archie and
I attended; but you've got to have been down into the pit and come
back again before you realise the terrible force there is in these
truisms. And no less in doing things than undoing them afterwards
(when that has been necessary) have I planned to the very last
<i>minutiæ</i>. If I have never seemed a particularly busy man, that has
been because I have always disliked being seen in the act of doing a
thing. And where I have passed my trail is obliterated.</p>

<p>Archie Merridew and I were only half contemporaries. He was younger
than I by a good seven years&mdash;was, as a matter of fact, only
twenty-three when he died. And in nearly everything else we were as
sharply contrasted as we were in our fortunes. Indeed, we were much
more so, for while I miserably coveted that thirty-eight pound upper
floor of his near the Foundling Hospital, my faith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> in myself and my
ambition would have helped me over that. Physically, we were as
different as we could be. My almost gigantic size made me, in my
cramped red and green lighted apartment, an enormously overgrown
squirrel in the smallest of cages; but to Archie's rather dandified
little dapperness his series of roof chambers was spacious as a
palace. Mentally we diverged even more. I was taciturn, he lively as
one of the crickets that used to chirp behind his little Queen Anne
teapot of a fireplace. And as for luck&mdash;well, if luck ever so much as
nodded to me in those days, it seemed to change its mind and to pass
by on the other side, while he seemed to pull things off the more
easily the more recklessly he blundered.</p>

<p>And he had his people at Guildford, while I had never a soul in the
world.</p>

<p>I don't know how we contrived to hit it off as well as, on the whole,
we did. Perhaps that too was part of his lucky disposition&mdash;he could
get along even with me. He always spread some sort of a weak charm
about him, and this charm always disarmed me even, when to all intents
and purposes he was merely rubbing in my horrible poverty. He would
tell me, as if I wasn't already eating my heart out about it, that it
was about time I made an effort&mdash;that <i>he</i> wasn't going to remain in
those stuffy diggings of his all <i>his</i> days&mdash;and that if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> had only
half my brains he'd be up somewhere pretty high in a very short time
(as he probably would had he lived)&mdash;all this, you understand, for my
good, the cigarette gummed to his prettily shaped upper lip wagging as
he talked, and with the best intentions in the world. He was quite
devoted to me; would tell me how he had told other people about those
extraordinary brains of mine; and he never dreamed (though it was not
long before I began to) that our respective ages were even then making
of our companionship a hopeless thing. A lad of seventeen may attach
himself for a time to a man whose years number twenty-four of
bitterness and exclusion, but they will part company again before the
one is twenty-three and the other thirty.</p>

<p>I was only an evening student at the Business College, while Archie
spent his days there. Often enough he did not turn up in the evening
at all; indeed, he only began to do so with unfailing regularity some
time after Evie Soames had put her name down for the social evening
course of lectures on Business Method. Evie Soames was a day student
too, though only on three days in the week, Mondays, Wednesdays, and
Fridays; and the lectures on Method were given in the evening because
they were specially addressed to those who, like myself, were employed
during the day, and deemed to be ripe for the more advanced
instruction. I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> think Archie was very much wiser for Weston's
(our lecturer) efforts, but he was genuinely grateful to me for my
explanations of them afterwards, and would pat me on the shoulder
affectionately, and tell me he couldn't understand why everybody else
didn't see what a rare good sort I was. That was his backhanded idea
of a compliment.</p>

<p>I think, in those early days of mine, I hated pretty well everything
and everybody; and I cannot better show you how little I found to love
than by giving you, before I go on with my tale, an account of my day
at that period of my life&mdash;any day taken at random will do.</p>

<p>I had to be at Rixon Tebb &amp; Masters' by nine, why, I don't know, since
nobody else of any account whatever turned up much before half-past
ten. But eight of us had to be there by nine o'clock, and I will tell
you how our eight had been got together.</p>

<p>You know&mdash;or don't you know?&mdash;that there are firms that contract for
the supply of "office labour" of all grades, from the messenger boy to
the beginning of the confidential clerks; holusbolus, in the lump, as
much of it or as little as you please. You pay, if you are an
employer, a certain number of hundreds a year, and the agency does the
rest. One down, t'other up; sack one man, and telephone for another.
The agency's supply, at the maximum of a pound a week, is practically
unlimited, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> firm escapes all personal responsibility in regard
to its staff.</p>

<p>I was one of these consignments of labour&mdash;or rather an eighth of one.
I don't know now what I did. I know that I addressed envelopes and
checked columns of figures and lists of names, quite devoid of meaning
to me, and got eighteen shillings a week for it. There was no chance
that I should ever get more than eighteen shillings. Ask for nineteen
and the telephone rang, the agency was informed of your request, and
... well, three times I had seen that happen.</p>

<p>One chance of escape, indeed, we had; the firm was clever enough to
allow us that. It was by way of what I may call the permanent junior
clerkship. The permanent junior clerk was, as it were, breveted with
the rank of the real clerks in the inner office; and so was hope
dangled over the heads of eight of us. There was the junior clerkship
amongst the eight of us. That or nothing.</p>

<p>I need hardly say that jealousy, espionage, and scheming besmirched
our souls.</p>

<p>Well (to continue my account of my day), I addressed envelopes or read
aloud from interminable lists until one o'clock, and then I lunched.
This we were not allowed to do in the office, so that usually I ate
from a paper bag in one of the quieter streets, or else had a scone
and milk at an A.B.C.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> shop round the corner in Cheapside. I was
alone. My fellow-stuff from the agency, always on the lookout for a
pretext of mistrust, found one in my (I admit) uncommon face. I put in
the time until two, when I was not smothering up annoyance at those
who would turn round to stare at a man who had been made half a head
taller than the rest of the world, in wondering whether those about me
were as rich or worse off than I, and whether they were able to
procure a bath as cheaply and easily; and then I returned to Rixon
Tebb &amp; Masters' again. At six-thirty I proceeded home, washed, and
went out to dinner. I dined at one of the establishments near the
corner of Pentonville Road; you have seen them, there is an
arrangement of gas-jets behind a steamy window, and, in galvanised
iron trays, sausages and onions and saveloys fry. The proprietor of
the "pull-up" fetched my dinner out of the window on the prongs of a
toasting fork, and I ate it in a small matchboard compartment, or,
when these <i>cabinets particuliers</i> happened to be all pre-occupied, at
an oilcloth-covered table that ran down the middle of the shop. During
and after my meal I read the whole of <i>The Echo</i>&mdash;I was allowed as a
habitué to retain my seat longer than the casual diner. But on the
nights on which I took a bath (did I say I sponged on Archie Merridew
for this convenience, carrying my clean shirt in a paper that also
served<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> for the wrapping-up of the one I had removed?), I added to my
obligation by supping with him also, and then we walked on to the
Business College together. My clothes I bought in Lamb's Conduit
Street, my boots in Red Lion Passage. I had always the greatest
difficulty in getting a fit in either. At one time I had the
misfortune to make myself very unpopular among the proprietors of a
row of barrows not far from Southampton Row. This was over the
purchase of a collar, and the cub under the naphtha lamp had made some
joke or other about the uncommon size I required, saying that the
horse collars were to be had in St Martin's Lane. The blow under the
ear I gave him was heavier than I intended; I am afraid I broke his
jaw, and I avoided the street for a long time.</p>

<p>After the class, I either continued my studies, as I have said, with
young Merridew, or else took a walk. In this again I was always alone.
I went far afield. If I went west, I usually turned along Great
Russell and Guildford Streets, but the moths, English and foreign, of
the half light of this last thoroughfare caused me at one time to take
the way of Holborn and Gray's Inn Road. The nickname they gave me,
they also gave, I don't doubt, to fifty men besides myself, but it
seemed somehow to attach itself more conspicuously to me because of my
general conspicuousness. It was that of the mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> and ubiquitous
author of a series of unelucidated crimes as to the nature of which I
need not be specific.</p>

<p>Then, when I had walked my fill, I returned to my cage opposite the
red and green electric advertisement.</p>

<p>This is a fair sample of my days at that time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p><br></p>
<h3>II</h3>

<p>There is a showy boot shop now where the Business College used to be;
the new place is in Kingsway. There, in Kingsway, I am told they have
methods and appliances undreamed of in my time&mdash;mechanical
calculators, wonderful filing systems, elaborate duplicators, and
lectures on Commercial and Political Economy and Mercantile Law&mdash;but
the old Holborn curriculum included shorthand, typewriting,
book-keeping, and lectures on method and not very much besides. When I
left, I remember, they were just beginning, as a high novelty,
advertisement-writing. Later, I myself took this class, though only
for a few weeks.</p>

<p>Even then, I think, the Holborn place was condemned to come down. A
second-hand book shop occupied the ground floor; and above the book
shop window three columns, each of three bow windows, one for each
floor, formed the frontage. The three bow windows of the top floor
were ours. Inside, the place was small and inconvenient in the
extreme. It had been a dwelling-house once, and the old fixtures still
remained&mdash;dark cauliflower wallpapers, heavy ornamental gas-brackets,
and little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> porcelain fittings by the fireplaces that still rang, in
the second of the two rooms that had been knocked into one to form a
lecture-room, a row of bells that resembled a series of interrogation
marks.</p>

<p>Only four women attended the classes. The business woman was,
comparatively speaking, a rarity then, nor can I quite make up my mind
as to how much things have changed in this respect and how much they
remain exactly as they were. They have certainly changed if it is all
on account of her certificate that a young woman can now walk into an
office and be promptly asked at what hour it will be convenient for
her to begin her duties on the morrow; and, lacking certificates,
three of our four students could hardly have fallen back on any
natural diploma of personal charms. I mean, in a word, that Miss
Windus, Miss Causton and Miss Levey were, to say the least, not
remarkably pretty, though Miss Causton was beautiful as far as her
figure and movements went.</p>

<p>But Evie Soames was very different. She was, in actual years, twenty;
but she seemed still to stand among the debris of her teens as an
opening tree stands over its sprinkling of delicate fallen sheaths in
the spring. Both graces and awkwardnesses of an earlier time still
clung, as it were, to her stem. She had, as I later learned, been at
one school until she was seventeen, at a second school until she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
nineteen, and now, after a year of indetermination and arrested
development at home, was still further delaying her maturity by
beginning again not very differently from the way in which she had
begun at fourteen. She had, of course, picked up a number of
unimportant acquirements by the way, but had never, in those days when
I first knew her, given it a thought that Evie Soames was a person
Evie Soames might well have some natural curiosity about. She moved,
neither woman nor schoolgirl, among the charts and files and dusty
ledgers of the Business College, slender, dark, necked like a birch,
and with eyes than which, when she looked suddenly round, the flash of
a negro's teeth was not whiter.</p>

<p>I have told you how my days were passed, but not yet said anything
about my dreams. As I cannot speak of Evie Soames apart from these I
will do so as briefly as I can.</p>

<p>Whatever else in my life I may have been, I have not, even in my
dreams, been a sensualist. It might in some respects have been better
for me if I had. But so far was I from that that I have even been
charged (though the charge is really as wide of the mark as it could
well be) with a certain inhumanity; by which I mean, not cruelty,
but&mdash;how shall I express it?&mdash;a certain inaccessibility to the
ordinary human relation. And I do not believe the woman lives who,
given her choice of these two interpretations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> of the word, would not
prefer the former. Only in the latter does she foresee her final
defeat.</p>

<p>Therefore, when at midday in Cheapside, or in Guildford Street as I
returned from my lonely rambles, or in Holborn or Oxford Street at the
hour when shops and offices turned out their human contents, male and
female, after the day's work, I watched the pattering feet on the
pavements, I was not stirred as the fleshly stockbrocker or
conscienceless "blood" is stirred. (You must allow me this
generalisation; you know what I mean.) My eyes did not meet other eyes
as seeking acquaintance. I never, in train or tram or 'bus, set off my
vacation of my seat for a woman against the bow or thanks I might
receive. I never, even at my loneliest, held a waitress or attendant
in talk for any satisfaction I had in her nearness. Whatever I have
learned from crowds, crowds have had nothing of mine. Nor, my heavy
and immobile appearance notwithstanding, was I (I affirm this) a
solitary because I was refused acquaintanceship. I was a solitary
because I refused it.</p>

<p>But what I refused in the streets by day, I could not sleep for
seeking when I lay down at night. What I sought I did not and do not
know; I was only conscious of a hunger within myself that, not being
satisfiable by the eye-profferings and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> partial prettinesses of
the crowd, were never offered that sustenance. I have heard this
hunger described as a Divine Discontent, but that is to beg a question
of some magnitude. It might be a very different thing from that. It
might just conceivably be an Infernal Discontent. Or it might, in the
case of a man who regarded neither God nor devil&mdash;But I wander. This,
I say, was my dream, and I shared it with no sensualist.</p>

<p>Of course you have already guessed why I say all this ... guessed what
happened. Between the commonnesses under the street lamps which I
spurned, and those dreams that were ever unseizably beyond my most
ardent reaching forth, I fell in love with Evie Soames.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" >

<p>There are, I know, men in whom a grim and uncompromising aspect is so
richly compensated for by other gifts that, like John Wilkes, they may
fairly brag that with fifteen minutes' start they would out-distance
in a woman's favours the most regular-featured buck in London.
Therefore (if I may use a "therefore" without egregiousness) it
troubled me little that Miss Windus, not to speak of her two
companions, Miss Causton and Miss Levey, found me unattractive. In
that coin I could have repaid her, had I wished, with interest. Since
I did not wish, my attitude was one of fully-armed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> reserve. All three
of these women seemed to me to be for ever proclaiming, if not in
words, yet in everything but words, that men, <i>as</i> men, have worldly
opportunities given them by a sort of favouritism, and as a kind of
present for their circumspection in getting themselves born men&mdash;as if
in this world either men or women ever got anything they were not
quick enough or strong enough or callous enough to seize for
themselves. Miss Windus in especial, a sharp-featured woman of
twenty-eight, with apertures like little scalene triangles out of
which her eyes peered with an expression quizzical and weak and yet
perky and self-confident at the same time (as if she was saying
perpetually to herself, "We may as well hear what <i>this</i> one has to
say for himself!") struck me as being the final word in
self-importance and inefficiency.</p>

<p>The top-heavy little Jewess, Miss Levey, was a very broker for gossip
and tattle, and the remarks she occasionally made about others to me
were quite enough to warn me that she would make equally free with
myself to others. Both she and Miss Windus seemed to shout aloud the
very sex-difference the existence of which they seemed at the same
time to be denying. They "could not think of giving trouble" when one
or other of the forty men placed a chair or adjusted a light or
carried a Remington for them; but they would have known how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> to show
their sense of the absence of such attentions all the same.</p>

<p>I do not know that Miss Causton pleased me very much more, but she at
any rate moved with a wonderful physical harmonious grace and flow. If
one might judge from her hands and wrists (a business certificate on
which she ever bestowed the most sedulous care) she did not come from
quite the same social level as the other two&mdash;was, perhaps, the
daughter of a doctor who had married his house-keeper, or of a decent
governess whose decency had not prevented her from running off with a
groom; but I made no attempt to unravel either this riddle or any
other that her rather contemptuous grey eyes might contain. The
attitudes she took in reaching down a book from a shelf or passing her
arm about the waist of one of the other girls when they assembled for
gossip were all I wanted of her, and those began and remained a purely
æsthetic satisfaction.</p>

<p>Therefore there could hardly have been a more complete contrast than
there was between these apparently a-sexual yet in reality excessively
sex-conscious women and my delicate unawakened Evie Soames. She made
no more difficulty about giving me a "Good-evening," or "Good-night"
than she did with the rest of the world; and though for a long time
our speech stopped at that, it was yet as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> much as I had with any
other woman whomsoever. That I should get even thus much of what
everybody else in the world seemed to get as a matter of course came
so gently and softly over me that I did not dream of a worse misery
that might lurk hidden within it, and in those early days of my love a
mother would not have fought more wildly for her babe than I would
have turned on any who had offered to come between me and even this
sparse sweetness that had come for the first time into my life.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p><br></p>
<h3>III</h3>

<p>The events I am now about to relate occurred during those early days,
while I was still content to possess my dreams, as if as long as I
closed my eyes the world would stand still about me.</p>

<p>One November night, as the series of lectures on Method was drawing to
a close, I returned with Archie Merridew to his rooms, silent, but
exceedingly happy. The cause of my happiness will not greatly excite
you, it had been no more than Evie's "Good-night, Mr Jeffries," given
me as I had waited on the stairs of the college for young Merridew,
who had lingered behind to ask Weston something or other.</p>

<p>I had heard them coming down from the landing above, and, looking up,
had seen the trail of Miss Causton's long grey coat and Miss Windus's
blue and green plaid skirt and her gloved hand on the shaky old rail.
I ought to say that the western-most of the three pillars of bow
windows I have mentioned as forming the Holborn frontage of the
college was the one that lighted the various floors of the staircase,
and if parties had ever been given in that old house before it had got
quite so old, it is odds that the embrasure in which I had <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
just then been standing, that of the first floor, had held a few palms in pots
and a couple of figures on its low window-seat many a time. But that
night it had only held myself, waiting in the shadow shaped like a
coffin-shoulder that the globeless gas of the landing cast.</p>

<p>I had heard Miss Windus's little smothered exclamation. "<i>Oh!...</i> That
man!" but instantly she had gone on talking in a higher voice.
Certainly she had had reasonable colour for the pretence that she had
not seen me&mdash;had I not happened to hear her exclamation.</p>

<p>And if I had heard it, so, of course, had Evie.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Mr Jeffries," Evie had said as she had passed me, and
Miss Windus also, as if suddenly discovering me, had given me quite a
bright "Good-night!" Miss Causton also had given me a languid, almost
insolent smile.</p>

<p>I was happy. I should probably have taken myself and my happiness off
somewhere had it not been that that evening I had made use of Archie's
bath, and had left in his place, besides that paper parcel I have
mentioned, a notebook of which I had need. So I had returned with
Archie, and, not intending to stay, had yet sat down, overcoated as I
was, before his fire.</p>

<p>"Better take your coat off for a bit," Archie said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> "I'd like a
squint at your notes too, if you're not in a hurry."</p>

<p>The notes were part of our preparation for the examination in Method
which was to be held shortly before Christmas. I threw apart, but
still did not remove my coat, and Archie took up my notebook and read
as he stood. Presently, feeling for a chair with his foot, he sat
down, still reading the notes.</p>

<p>He looked up from time to time, but the questions he put barely
interrupted my reverie. I stared at the fire in the pretty
old-fashioned grate. He had no gas up there; his cardboard lamp-shade,
green outside and a little heat-browned inside, stood on a
chenille-clothed table; and he had given the shade a tilt for his
convenience in reading. Thus the fireplace end of the room lay in a
sort of irregular parabola of illumination. There were bright circles
on the ceiling above the chimney of the lamp; then came spaces of cosy
gloom; and below, in the pleasant light, were his arm-chairs, his
small book-shelf, and, the rail of it catching the firelight, his high
perforated brass fender. In the middle of a great cam of light that
lay over the dimity-papered wall between his sitting and bed rooms,
his dressing-gown, hanging from a hook in the bedroom door, made a
grotesquely human-shaped shadow.</p>

<p>By-and-by, with the book on his knee and his eyes still fixed on it,
Archie began mechanically to unlace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> his boots. I looked up as he
reached for his slippers, and then resumed my reverie.</p>

<p>I was glad that Kitty Windus, whether she realised it or not, had been
made the subject of an innocently awkward little snub. I couldn't
stand the woman. I couldn't stand it that, ignoring my existence when
she could, she spoke to me, when she did speak, with a false vivacity
that only enhanced the effect of her passing over at other times. And
lest you should think I was wasting my detestation on a rather
insignificant object, I must ask you again to remember what my days
were. The whole Scheme of Things seemed to be against me; but there is
not much relief to be had from taking a blind fling at the Scheme of
Things. A man with a grudge against the world will be very likely
indeed to take that grudge out of the nearest person. I was not
prosperous enough to have much time to waste on human charities. So,
in my resentful hours, I took it mercilessly out of one against whom,
in my calmer moments, I had no grudge except that she was not a
thousand miles away. And if she had been a thousand miles away, I
should have vented my bitterness on somebody else. I had to get rid of
it somehow.</p>

<p>But if my thoughts gave Miss Windus more of this than she fairly
deserved, perhaps Evie Soames got more in another sort than she
deserved either.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> There was not one of the few stray graces and
sweetnesses I had ever known that did not accrete to and abide about
the thought of her. No generous emotion, no human impulse I had ever
experienced, but came with adoration and rich gifts with which to
exalt her. In my heart I lighted tapers about her image. I did not ask
myself whether she had supplanted my dreams, existed side by side with
them, or was indeed my dreaming made truth. I did not wonder what she
might have been in another man's dreaming, nor whether, apart from the
dreaming of some man, she existed spiritually at all. I only knew that
the fire inside Archie Merridew's fender was not warmer than that
central warmth that seemed to steal (as if there also some bud-sheath
had yielded) about my heart as I pictured again her sapling-straight
figure, the flash of her turning eyes on the landing, and the tone in
which she had bidden me good-night three quarters of an hour before. I
leaned back as it were in some longed-for luxurious resting-place of
the heart. I do not know the origin of the tears that gathered in my
eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly Archie threw the book on to the table and stretched himself.
He gave a yawn and put his feet on the fender.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sick of work for to-day!" he said. "When are you going to
start smoking?" he added as he drew out a cigarette-case.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>I answered something or other&mdash;it didn't matter what, since my lovely
moment had gone with the breaking in of his voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, well!..." he laughed, lighting up. Then, glancing at the blowing
end before throwing his match into the fender, he said: "I say&mdash;what a
jolly sort of girl that Miss Soames seems to be!"</p>

<p>As the cold of a spring night freezes the newly mounting sap of a
tree, so I felt some sweet and vigorous change suddenly arrested in my
heart.</p>

<p>"Wh-who?" I said. I had to make two attempts at it.</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course&mdash;I forgot, girls don't interest you. Like your not
smoking, I suppose. Hadn't noticed there were any girls at the
college&mdash;only see text-books and Remingtons.... Well, not to spring it
on you too suddenly, there <i>are</i> four girls there, three of 'em rather
sticks, but the fourth a ripper. What a rum chap you are!" he
concluded with another laugh.</p>

<p>He had drawn his chair still closer to the fire, and now sat with his
feet, not on the fender, but half-way up one of the pilasters that
supported the chimneypiece. As he kicked off one slipper and began to
warm one small foot on the iron-work just inside the pilaster, his
profile was turned to me; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> I didn't at first risk stealing a look
at it for fear of meeting his eyes. Stealthily, however, and moving my
head as little as possible, I did so. It was a pretty profile&mdash;fair
curly hair thick on the crown, his head rather high at the back and of
a long shape to the chin, good nose, pleasantly curved mouth&mdash;the head
of a decent enough but quite unremarkable youngster of twenty-two. He
was neatly dressed in a grey stripe, and wore a black-bound red
waistcoat with brass buttons. I say he was decent enough, and so he
was: I knew he knew the taste of whiskey, but don't think he drank it
very often. "Good wholesome beer," he used to say with an air of
experience, "was more his mark"; but even then I think the experience
was more that of his companions than his own. You wouldn't have said
there was much harm in him, and he would probably have to spend his
allowance unwisely once or twice before he learned to spend it wisely.</p>

<p>I made the moving of my chair an excuse for getting him better under
observation.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, awfully jolly," he repeated, blowing a plume of smoke through
which the firelight shone rustily. "Fun ... no end of fun ...
rather!..."</p>

<p>Then he smiled, and the smile came and went and came again as he
smoked.</p>

<p>I don't know why, up to that moment, I had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> thought of it&mdash;never
thought of how it might already be or might presently become. I
suppose the reason was that a man cannot hold the commerce I held with
dreams without to some extent losing his touch of actuality. But now,
at last, I was awake enough.... As if the room had turned colder I
pulled my coat a little more closely about me.</p>

<p>It was not then that that heart of mine, which I have likened to a bud
suddenly arrested in the moment of its unfolding, became more
likenable to a grenade with its fuse waiting exposed for the spark
that should bring destruction....</p>

<p>But I was quite calm. For the matter of that, I am never anything else
when it comes to the point. My angers have served their purpose when
they have brought me to the point. I <i>use</i> anger.... Therefore, though
I knew already that three careless words of his had opened an
immeasurable abyss between us, I was able to speak to him without a
tremor, from my chair at one side of his hearth to him in his own at
the other.</p>

<p>"You mean Miss&mdash;&mdash;What's her name?"</p>

<p>"Soames," he informed me. "You know&mdash;that young girl&mdash;you must have
seen her.... Yes, full of fun.... I laughed.... I did laugh!"</p>

<p>From the way in which he still laughed there must have been a specific
occasion for his mirth. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> knew of none such. I wished to know,
however, and I also wished to know what he meant by "fun." Young men
mean so many things by "fun," and it&mdash;But I stifled something within
my breast almost before it was born there. When I spoke, my voice was
as steady as it has ever been in my life; but the devil, watching a
soul that hesitates on the point of sin, does not watch more closely
than I watched that fair boy with the cigarette dangling from his
upper lip.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, I've seen her.... <i>Pretty, too</i>," I hinted.</p>

<p>But he put, if he heard, her prettiness aside. He chuckled again.</p>

<p>"I went last Sunday to the Zoo, you know," he said. "They were
spending the week-end in town&mdash;my folks. And I saw her there. Or
rather, I didn't see her at first, it was Mumsie who saw her. 'I think
there's somebody you know,' she says to me, and I looked, and there
she was, bowing to me. Then up came pater&mdash;he'd dropped behind
somewhere&mdash;and blest if he didn't know her aunt&mdash;she lives with her
aunt&mdash;they have rooms in Woburn Place. So we all went round
together.... I started the fun by saying how like old Weston the
secretary bird was; so we went round looking for likenesses&mdash;raked up
everybody we knew&mdash;&mdash;" He stopped, suddenly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>He wouldn't, had he been a year or two older, have pulled himself up
quite so sharply. It is true he didn't go so far as to colour,
stammer, or bite his lip; but his meaning, or his inadvertence, or
whatever you like to call it, could hardly have been plainer had he
done all these things. An anecdote was related to me not so very long
ago by an agent I employ to advise me in my picture-buying. It was of
the most sardonic of our caricaturists, and this merciless artist had
(so the story ran) refused to caricature a certain person, giving as
his reason that, while a vain or over-praised or too consciously
handsome face was fair game for his ironic pencil, a face already
heavily visited by nature went free. But for Archie Merridew's sudden
embarrassed check I might have imagined that <i>my</i> own visage might
have gone free also. It is, after all, not repellent. I bear quite a
strong resemblance to at least one public man whose photographs appear
in the illustrated papers&mdash;a distinguished scientist. My stature is
the most striking thing about me, and if your humour takes that turn
you can find remote suggestions of any number of people at the Zoo.</p>

<p>I made, however, no sign, and he, judging his clumsiness to have
passed unnoticed, went on:</p>

<p>"Funny the pater knowing her aunt like that, wasn't it? Rather fun
though. Mumsie said she must come down to Guildford for a few days
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> stay with us; if she does I shall go home that week-end&mdash;you
bet!"</p>

<p>My answer gave me no pain. It came, I think, out of just such an
automatic reflex as causes an "opening" in conversation to call forth
its own obvious reply. It would have been more marked not to say it
than to say it, and as I am telling you, in my state of still tension
it didn't hurt.</p>

<p>"Oh!" I said. "And when does one congratulate you?"</p>

<p>"What d'you mean?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, on your engagement."</p>

<p>Instantly I knew I had said the right thing. There was nothing either
false or forced about the little exclamation he made, half scoff, half
laugh. His face was clear as crystal. By "fun" he meant, simply, mere
physiological laughter, the bubbling-up of the high spirits of his
years. Human resemblances at the Zoo are quite enough to call up this
purely functional giggling. She was "fun" (the odds were a thousand to
one) as his sister might have been fun; with a certain freshness and
sense of discovery perhaps, but otherwise not very differently. In
spite of the sequel, I still think I am right in making this
statement.</p>

<p>"Don't be an idiot!" he said.... "I say, Jeff, I couldn't quite make
out that about indexing and cross-references to-night. Did he mean
that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> cross-references are a sort of double entry for when the
subjects overlap, or what?"</p>

<p>But there was still something I wished to verify.</p>

<p>"Who?" I asked. "The&mdash;secretary bird?"</p>

<p>This time I think he did colour faintly, but as he had swung his legs
down from the fireplace and was reaching for my notebook again I could
not be quite sure.</p>

<p>"Pass me the book," I said.</p>

<p>For the next quarter of an hour I gave him as collected and lucid an
explanation of his difficulties as if I had had no other care in the
world. Then I lifted myself up. I buttoned my coat, put the notebook
into my pocket, and briefly recapitulated what I had told him.</p>

<p>"Thanks, awfully," he said gratefully, when I had finished. "You are a
brick. <i>You</i> ought to give the lectures instead of old Weston. I'm
sure if I pass this exam it will be all you. Must you go?"</p>

<p>"Must."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;so long&mdash;I think I'll make a few notes myself before I forget
again."</p>

<p>And, still master of myself, I left him arranging papers and feeling
in his inkstand for a pen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p><br></p>
<h3>IV</h3>

<p>I do not know but what I might still have retained control of myself
when I got out into the street again; I do not know, because I didn't
try. Instead, no sooner had I got away from him than I went
temporarily all to pieces. I remember I passed up Charlotte Street and
turned into Mecklenburgh Square; and there I leaned against the
railings of the garden that occupies the middle of the Square. I stood
with my shoulder against them, looking stupidly down at my feet. There
was a thin and melancholy mist; the lights of the boarding-houses and
nursing-homes of the east side of the Square struggled through it with
difficulty, and presently I found that my foot was playing absently
with a few sodden plane-tree leaves that had drifted against the kerb.</p>

<p>Slowly, as I stood there, my stupidity gave place to a dull anger. I
don't think it was anger against anybody in particular; it was as
objectless as it was useless and exhausting. But if you have had that
gall in your mouth that makes all the world taste bitter, you will
understand my miserable rage. This changed presently to a shivering,
weeping rage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> The wide portalled door of a house opposite opened, and
a servant-girl came down the shallow steps to post a letter; I daresay
she supposed I was unwell or a drunkard; and a passer-by might have
concluded that I had an assignation with her, or had just had a
quarrel.</p>

<p>Then, when I had had a little ease of my anger, I pulled myself
together and banished it again. Now that I had come, tardily enough,
out of my fool's paradise of the past weeks, I had other things than
purposeless anger to think of. I moved away from the railings; the
maid, returning from the posting of her letter, quickened her steps to
avoid me; and I walked slowly northeastward through the Square.</p>

<p>Quickly I became calmer still. Soon I was calm enough to recognise
that I needed this. "What," I said ironically to myself,
thunder-struck at a thing so very surprising! "Did you think that
because your head was in the clouds ... come, come, you'd better look
at the thing; you mayn't have any too much time, you know; if I were
you I'd take a walk and think it out."</p>

<p>I turned into Grays Inn Road, and began to take my own advice.</p>

<p>While I had no reason to suppose that she had fallen in love with him,
I knew almost for a certainty that he had not with her. He was not at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
that stage yet. Already he was nibbling at other pleasures, and with a
youngster of his kind one or two nibbles mean three or four. They may
even mean ten or twelve. So far so good. I was still in time. I was,
in fact, so far beforehand that, of the three of us, I was probably
the only one who knew, not what had happened (which was nothing) but
what might happen&mdash;which was everything. That I took for the
starting-point of my consideration.</p>

<p>And I saw that that, at the outset, was an enormous advantage to me.
Not only could I watch events, but I could watch them to infinitely
better purpose that I knew what to look for. They, when it came&mdash;the
"it" I had in my mind&mdash;(I ought rather to say did I suffer it to come)
would not, in the bewildering wonder of it, know what had overtaken
them; while I, by a timely use of care and skill, might even turn to
advantage those disadvantages of mine which, huge as a church, might
have been deemed to outweigh everything else. No more perfect cover
for hidden motion could have been devised than I already possessed.
Who suspects, of anything, one whom to suspect would on the face of it
be absurd? I could, did I find this necessary, use practically the
whole of my conspicuous life and narrow circumstances as a screen.</p>

<p>I reached the top of Gray's Inn Road, crossed to St Pancras Station,
and, following the line of coal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> merchants' offices on the left side
of the road, plunged into the shadows of the Somers Town arches. It
was there that I thought of another thing that I must interrupt my
meditation to acquaint you with.</p>

<p>You may have wondered why, if all young Merridew said about my brains
was true, I had still, after some years as an agency clerk at Rixon
Tebb &amp; Masters', not been able to get away from the place. Well, the
answer to that is involved in a hundred other things that have ended,
after fifteen years, in my now being able to write this chapter of my
personal history at a great square mahogany and leather writing-table,
with two softly-shaded electric standards upon it, and, containing it,
a lofty panelled study, rich and quiet, with a carpet soft as thymy
turf and my pictures and carvings and cabinets mirrored in
floor-borders, brown and deep as the pools of my Irish trout stream.
You do not want the whole of that long story. I will tell you as much
as is necessary here. The rest I may tell at some other time.</p>

<p>The truth was that I <i>had</i> left Rixon Tebb &amp; Masters'&mdash;had left the
place, and had achieved the seeming miracle of being permitted to
return. Such a marvel was without precedent, and I cannot say that it
had been accomplished altogether by my own contrivance. I said a
little while ago that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> were eight of us, had over in a lump from
the agency; I also said that only by way of the junior clerkship was
any advancement possible from that slavery of addressing envelopes
that might have been for company circularisation or might have been
sent over in shiploads to the Flushing and Middleburg book-makers for
all we knew; and I had had the signal luck&mdash;I forgot this when I said
that luck had always passed me by on the other side&mdash;to present myself
for reappointment, without any hope whatever of getting it, at the
very moment when Polwhele had succeeded to this post.</p>

<p>How Polwhele had chanced to be occupied as he had been occupied when I
had presented myself I understand only too well. Sneaking, prying,
slandering, peaching&mdash;you didn't become Rixon Tebb &amp; Masters' junior
clerk without having been through the mill of all this and more. Poor
worm, he had got so used to it that he couldn't help it. Having
attained to the junior clerkship, he was going to work up through the
seniors by the same means, I suppose, and the means he had been making
use of, at the moment of my coming upon him, had been the furtive
rummaging of a waste-paper basket that had come&mdash;I knew this by the
pattern of it&mdash;from Mr Masters' private office.</p>

<p>It had been, of course, the perfect opportunity for me, who was
subdued to sneaking and peaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> also. I had leaned my elbow on the
brass rail of a tall desk and stood looking down on him&mdash;such a long
way down it seemed&mdash;he was on his knees.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Polwhele!" I had suddenly said. "Going to put Samson Evitt out
of business?" And then I waited to see how he took it.</p>

<p>I don't suppose you've ever heard of Samson Evitt. He has been a
solicitor; at that time he described himself as a waste-paper dealer;
and what he really did, and for all I know does still, was to buy up,
through a hundred miserable agents, and on the chance of coming upon
some private letter or secret draft, the contents of such receptacles
as Polwhele's fingers had been deep in at that moment.</p>

<p>"Going to start in Samson's line, are you, Polwhele?"</p>

<p>The colour of his face had changed as swiftly as that of the electric
advertisement opposite my bedroom at King's Cross. He had gone as
white as chalk. I had known perfectly well that he wasn't going to
sell anything to Samson Evitt, but was merely playing his own hand
with the firm; but he'd had no business at all with Mr Masters'
waste-paper basket, and knew it. It had been rather horrible, but I
had known I was as good as reinstated already.</p>

<p>"I'm coming back, Polwhele," I had said.</p>

<p>He had not spoken&mdash;only looked at me with eyes full of terror.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're going to see that I come back, Polwhele," I had informed him.</p>

<p>"My God, Jeffries, you wouldn't have the heart."</p>

<p>"Oh no&mdash;not as long as I come back."</p>

<p>Then swiftly he had seen his years of shifts and meannesses all wasted
unless....</p>

<p>"Oh my God! How can I do it?" he had groaned.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Polwhele."</p>

<p>I did not know, nor do I know now how he did it. Men do impossible
things when they've got to. That had been on a Friday evening, at a
quarter to seven (the zeal of a new junior clerk always kept him after
the others had gone). I had given him Monday in which to see to it. On
the Tuesday morning, at nine o'clock, I had been back at my envelope
addressing again. These things have to be done sometimes. And I need
hardly add that now Polwhele would have turned up at my funeral with a
smile on his lips and a nosegay in his buttonhole.</p>

<p>Of the period between my leaving Rixon Tebb &amp; Masters' and my return
thither I will not speak. You may guess at the nature of its
experiences from the fact that I was thankful to get back to my lists
and addresses again.</p>

<p>It would have surprised my fellow-clerks, who saw in me one as
listless as themselves, to learn with what unresting energy I had
worked since then.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> I had resolved that my next leap from that
frying-pan should not be into the fire, and the means by which I was
making sure of this was the Business College in Holborn. I knew my
great natural gifts and the power that smouldered within me, but I had
also learned, and in a school where the lessons were well driven home,
that power and natural gifts were, for a man in my position,
practically worthless unless they were supplemented and guaranteed. I
had got to get myself certificated.</p>

<p>I don't know what certificates have come to mean nowadays, sometimes,
I fear, very little. They seem to me to have lowered the standard with
the utmost recklessness. I would not, in my own business, give a pound
a dozen for some of these artificially achieved successes that are
offered to me almost every day in the week, and it causes me no
surprise whatever when I see the highly certificated also
unemployed.... But it was rather different then. Once more I have
forgotten my luck and railed at the goddess. It was my luck to be
certificated while certificates still had a value, and for a year and
a half I had drifted through my occupation by day but worked with an
almost demoniac energy by night in order that I might not miss a
single one of these tickets of authenticity that it was possible for
me to obtain. A First Honours in Method would now complete my
equipment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>And, looking back now, I wonder how much superstition there was in it
that I wanted all the changes I was planning to come at once. For I
meant that the break, when it did come, should be clean and final. As
long as I remained with Rixon Tebb &amp; Masters' my wretched single room
at King's Cross was quite good enough for an agency clerk; when I left
Rixon Tebb &amp; Masters' I would leave those quarters also. Until then, I
don't think you could have dragged me out, so strongly had I this
feeling. Superstition or what you like, it had, for me, the force of a
large and wise, if not yet fully worked out strategy. They tried, of
course, at the Business College in Holborn, just as they are now
trying at the new place in Kingsway, to teach us this larger
generalship of waiting, withholding, massing, concentration, and then
the swift development and advance; but I don't think it was much good.
You don't get these things in return for so many guineas a year in
fees. But I felt their stirrings then.... I hope I have made it plain
that neither at the place in Kingsway, nor in my sordid lodgings over
the public-house, nor under the arches of Somers Town that night, was
I wasting my time.</p>

<p>And now, like a match to all that I had prepared and was preparing,
had come the kindling thought of Evie Soames.</p>

<p>I remember I walked to Hampstead that night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> revolving it all.
Walking always steadies me, and by the time I had reached the Lower
Heath the mechanical calculators at the new place in Kingsway do not
work more coldly and mathematically than my brain had begun to work.
The advantages I possessed, which had been the first thing to rush
into my head, I allowed for the present to take care of themselves; I
now envisaged my disadvantages.</p>

<p>You may imagine that these were terrifying.... I counted them, and was
unable to check my groans when, thinking I had come to the end of
them, yet another sprang up, stabbing me as it were from behind. They
might almost have been veritable assassins, springing out from behind
the dark bushes and copses near the Vale of Health among which I
wandered.... Think of them! Think of them!</p>

<p>They, he and she, were of an age, or nearly; I seven years the senior
of the elder of them. They met on three days a week at the college,
met doubtless to snigger together over their "fun," only on three
evenings could I see her. Her people apparently knew his; she would go
down to Guildford, and my fancy might picture them, together there,
taking walks, telling stories over the fire, laughing at chance
resemblances at the Zoo. And all this time I should not cease for a
moment to labour at that garden of my ambition above the brown mould
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> which not a green shoot yet showed. How (you must remember I was
desperately facing the worst that could happen and not the best)&mdash;how
could they help but fall in love? What would it be possible for me to
do but to discover the thing after it had happened? And when it had
happened, what was there then to be done?</p>

<p>But I need not force all this upon you. You will see for yourself.
Look at it, then, and tell me where you would have conceived the odds
to lie&mdash;with my possibly large-planning but certainly slow-executing
brain, or with them and their opportunities and luck and gifts of
circumstance and nature, demolishable singly perhaps, but well-nigh
invincible in the sum of them?</p>

<p>I weighed it as I strayed and stubbled about the benighted Heath.</p>

<p>I returned from Hampstead at three o'clock in the morning. My horror
of red and green had long since been switched off, and I got into bed
during the only quiet interval that noisy and populous corner ever
knew. I had now balanced advantages and disadvantages together, and
was recapitulating the whole. Examining, setting aside, bringing
forward again to re-examine in other aspects, setting aside again,
checking, dismissing, estimating&mdash;my brain worked like a ticking
instrument. Clocks struck, but still I pondered; and I was as free
from anger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> now as if it had been another, not I, who had sought the
support of the railings in Mecklenburgh Square.</p>

<p>And there dominated all my machination the single thought, that by no
slip or carelessness or overlooked detail must they be made aware
that I was watching them as a masked thief watches the uneasy sleeper
upon the bed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p><br></p>
<h3>V</h3>

<p>It was at Rixon Tebb &amp; Masters' that I first began to know jealousy,
or at least the image of it. I find I must say a little more about
this place in which I spent my days at that time.</p>

<p>I have said that Polwhele hated me; but nobody loved anybody else at
Rixon Tebb &amp; Masters'. I have worked in offices that have been not bad
fun at all; offices where the fellows formed a sort of family, as they
did afterwards at the Freight &amp; Ballast Company, with something not
unlike the family bond, the family jokes, and an interchange each
morning of the adventures of the night before not unlike the exchange
of items of news from letters about a family breakfast-table; but
there was nothing like that at Rixon Tebb &amp; Masters'. There, one of us
could scarcely glance up over the little brass rail at his desk-head
without seeing, across the spaces where the green porcelain cones of
the incandescents hung, another furtive pair of eyes meeting his own
and looking almost guiltily away again. If the partners despised us
for our cringing before them they were right; we were a despicable
set. I don't think a friendship was ever struck up in the place. We
hated, if for no other reason, than because each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> of us knew his
neighbour to be as contemptible as he knew himself to be.</p>

<p>It was in this atmosphere that I wrapped myself about with the thought
of Evie Soames. My routine work taxed my attention little; I could do
it as well as it needed to be done and live a whole free inner life at
the same time; and I was sometimes actually startled when, looking up
after some lapse and interim in which I had seen nothing but the shape
of Evie's birch-like neck and the brilliant motion of her eyes, I saw
the crafty gaze of a fellow-clerk on my face. Once I met Sutt's eyes
in this way; I knew his thought, namely, that he surmised the nature
of mine; and he smiled, a mean sort of smile. He didn't smile twice,
though, while I was there. I don't mean that I said or did anything,
but I think he knew what my look meant.... All the same there got
about the office&mdash;or rather about the corners and lavatories and
behind screens, for it never came nearer to me than that&mdash;the only
joke I remember ever to have been born there&mdash;the joke that Jeffries
had all the appearance of a man in love. I took the hint.
Thenceforward, as far as I might, I did not allow the faintest flicker
of an emotion to cross my face. And more than ever was I on my guard
lest I should do so in a place where it would have mattered more than
it did at Rixon Tebb &amp; Masters'.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, long before I knew of any valid grounds for them, and before a
brain less prospectively active than mine would as much as dreamed of
them, came these jealousies. Perhaps, like my occasional angers and
like that secret fragrant flame of my love, they were emotions at
large, unattached to any person but bound sooner or later to become so
attached, and already seeking a quarter in which to alight.</p>

<p>They wrung my heart. Hot flushes and rages sometimes came upon me
with no warning whatever. Sometimes in the middle of a column of
figures or a twelve-inch-high stack of addresses, a devil would slyly
lift its head&mdash;the thought that while I sat there polishing my
trousers on a tall stool and the wrist of my sleeve on my desk, he
and my Evie were&mdash;where?... I have in a remarkable degree that most
precious and most hideous of gifts, the gift of mental visualisation,
at these times it would have its way with me. I would see them in
those moments where I would and engaged how I would. Well nigh as
clearly as I see the page before me, I would see him, long boyish
head and fair curly hair, red waistcoat and cigarette, and turned-up
trousers and all, now making pretexts that something was wrong with
her typewriter, now carrying a specimen ledger for her, now choosing
for himself a place from which he could watch her, or even passing on
to her the explanations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> of knots and difficulties he had had the
previous evening from myself. My fancy (my reason at these times its
helpless slave) would dog them&mdash;past the general room into the
lecture-room&mdash;thence to the back room where the charts and apparatus
were kept&mdash;thence back again through the lecture room into the
shorthand and typewriting and senior class rooms, and so throughout
every corner behind our three Holborn bow windows. There were times
when I used all my powers of concentration to see one of them without
the other, and failed.... And then the fit would pass and my steady
reason would reassert itself. I would tell myself I was a fool to
thrust knives into myself thus. She was merely that touchingly
opening fair young tree; and as for him, if his young male
swaggerings in the pride of his twenty-two years included any
knowledge of girls at all, they were probably girls of a very
different class from hers.</p>

<p>Then would come the other damnable series again, and the sweat would
stand on my brow.</p>

<p>No wonder Sutt looked.</p>

<p>Yet I am not sure that, for the sake of certain purely heavenly hours,
I would not go through it all again. Would you suppose that in that
five-shilling room of mine, where I had to flatten myself against the
wall before I could take my clothes off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> unseen&mdash;or as I dined on
sausage and mashed at my reeking "pull-up"&mdash;or as I roamed the
pavements in search of the physical exhaustion that should bring
sleep&mdash;would you suppose that in these places and living this life I
could have heavenly hours? Ah, but I could, and had!... I don't want
you to think I am sentimentalising about it. The public-house
downstairs had knocked a good many ideas about the sanctity of our
common humanity out of my head. I never, in my fourpenny dining-place,
looked at the drayman or porter at the next table and wondered whether
he also knew the heights and abysses I knew. Doubtless he had or had
had his own, but all is <i>not</i> comparative. There <i>are</i> grades in
heaven and hell. I knew I stood out, exceptional, destined, marked for
signal honour or for signal dishonour. I had no desire to persuade
anybody else of this. These things are beyond proof. Attempt to prove
them and you but prove their opposites.</p>

<p>And so literally was this slender dark creature "my life," that often
at the college itself my resolution all but failed me. More (but not
much more) woman than child, she seemed at these times&mdash;what shall I
say?&mdash;not a wonder shrunk, but a receptacle strangely slight and
tender for the mighty things preparing for her. At such moments I
found myself looking years ahead&mdash;seeing many things over and behind
us, and myself, perhaps, turning my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> power elsewhere. And that moved
me more than all the rest. For my strength was ever being used for
her. Service of her was the law of it, as I now knew it had been its
origin. I sometimes had ado not to sob, when watching her young head
bent over the page of a text-book, images of great and brooding
protection of enfolding and strong and jealous wakefulness, filled my
breast as I looked. I felt in those moments that for every hair of her
head I could have killed a man and felt no compunction afterwards.</p>

<p>Evie caused me far more anxiety than Archie did. At all times Archie's
vanities, quite as amusing to watch as those of any young girl, would
blind him to much that lay an inch or two beyond the end of his nose.
He was, moreover, deep in his examination work, and I had no doubt
that, once the examinations were over, he would indulge himself in a
mild little "burst" and flatter his seraphic self he was rather a
devil in his way. But she was more difficult. For one thing, hers was
a richer nature. She had, or would presently have, far more to give;
and already I saw that, as surely as Miss Windus was one of Life's
takers, Evie Soames was one of Life's givers.</p>

<p>I watched&mdash;how I watched!&mdash;for the slightest of her unconscious
betrayals; and, of course, by dint of watching I was able to find a
thousand that presently vanished again. I drew trifling tremendous
conclusions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> from the merest nothings. She could not make a gawky,
captivating little movement but I would found something upon it, not a
pretty coltish gesture but I had my inference to draw. The smile,
perhaps, where lately the laugh would have been&mdash;the little check of
recollection, even as she was perching herself with a tomboyish swing
on the edge of a table, that she "was grown-up now"&mdash;slight little
ceremoniousnesses, stilted little phrases and momentary forgettings
again&mdash;I missed not one of these. My lovely, lovely flapper! Did you
know that you were twenty different creatures in a week, each beyond
words adorable until another swelling nodule yielded and allowed a
peep of a yet inner tender and rosy heart?</p>

<p>Of course I see now that I was far too clever in all this. I had, in
fact, taken the course that was least of all likely to tell me what I
wanted to know. For, as a face seen daily shows no change and yet
grows relentlessly older, so, because of my watching, she changed
under my eyes and my eyes did not tell me she had changed. I have had
in my time various things to say about "woman's intuition." I, like
the rest of us, have set half of it down as guessing and the other
half (the half that events falsify) as a convenient forgetfulness.
Well, I hope I make amends when I admit now that in all this I owed my
final enlightenment to a woman, and to the woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> to whom I would
least of all have been indebted&mdash;to Miss Windus.</p>

<p>It was on a Friday evening that this enlightenment came to me. Fridays
were ever a pain to me, because of the three whole days that must
elapse&mdash;five if she failed to appear on the Monday evening&mdash;before I
could see Evie again. Believe me, the last minutes of those Friday
evenings always cost me dearly in emotion; and in order that I might
make the most of them I had some time before discontinued a former
habit of mine&mdash;that of working in the senior students' classroom. By
so doing I had forestalled any remarks on the fact that I was
frequently to be found in the same room as Evie. And even then I knew
I was lucky to escape Miss Levey's Hebrew intensiveness.</p>

<p>But on that Friday night I was restless. An absurd trifle had
unsettled me (but I have told you how much such trifles meant to
me)&mdash;nothing more than an alteration in Evie's way of arranging her
hair. Until then it had been drawn back and massed in a thick little
clump on her nape, showing beautifully the small round of her head;
but now she had parted it (I did not think altogether more becomingly)
in the middle, and had evidently been making desperate attempts to
"wave" it. Certainly the change gave her at once a more adult air,
which I supposed I should get used to, unless, as was likely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> she
changed it again in the following week. Her blouse also was new. It
had a high lace collar up to her ears, and I didn't like it in the
least. It was mere concealment, without concealment's charm.</p>

<p>I was restless. I had begun the evening by working, for once, in the
senior classroom again; but presently, not happy where I was and not
wishing to go straightway into the lecture-room where Evie sat, I had
compromised by packing up my things and going into the room adjoining
hers&mdash;the general room. The reference books were kept in the general
room, and, presently, having need of one of these, I had crossed to
the shelf and taken it down.</p>

<p>I ought to explain that these books were kept in three projecting
bays, such as one sees in libraries, that stood out at right angles
from the wall. Thus the books of each projecting wing faced both ways
and between the bays there was just room enough for the short library
ladder of three or four steps with the vertical staff to steady
yourself by as you stood on it. As I could easily reach any book there
without the ladder, I had passed the bay that contained it, and had
taken up my place on the farther side of the wing nearest the window,
where I stood with the open book in my hand. I forget what the book
was.</p>

<p>As I stood I heard Miss Windus and Miss Causton come into the
adjoining compartment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>I had no great interest in either of these women&mdash;I may say none,
since I could not see Miss Causton's fluent hand; so, merely noting
their arrival, I was continuing my reading when suddenly I heard the
name of Evie Soames. It was Miss Windus who was speaking.</p>

<p>"... Oh, I suppose so; in her way, of course&mdash;if that's all men want!"
she was saying. "Don't you think?" This with a little acidulous rising
inflection.</p>

<p>Then I heard Miss Causton's indolent voice in reply. From the way in
which she spoke I fancied she was eating sweets. It had lately struck
me that she ate more sweets than both the other girls together, and if
it wasn't sweets it was something else.</p>

<p>"Don't ask <i>me</i>, my dear," she drawled. "<i>I</i> don't know what the
creatures want."</p>

<p>"Of course not. They do seem to want such&mdash;odd&mdash;things. The way I'm
looked at sometimes&mdash;I declare it makes me feel perfectly ashamed!"
said Miss Windus. Why she said it I don't know. It was the purest
hypocrisy, and it was not likely to impose on Miss Causton, who had a
nonchalant, still humour of her own.... But on second thoughts I don't
know. I was not always sure, afterwards, when I got to know Miss
Windus better, that she didn't really labour under some such delusion
as this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do they?" Miss Causton asked lazily. "They don't worry me much. So
long ago since I've seen one that I've nearly forgotten."</p>

<p>There was a short pause, then:</p>

<p>"Really, they stare so," Miss Windus continued, "look one so out of
countenance&mdash;one really doesn't know which way to turn!"</p>

<p>"No?" came Miss Causton's ironical dawdle. "Oh ... with a chance, my
dear ... <i>I</i> should!" ... I suppose she smiled as she said it. While
appearing to lay herself perfectly open she had far more to hide than
Miss Windus had.</p>

<p>Miss Windus was shocked.</p>

<p>"You <i>dreadful</i> girl!... But really Louie, you must have noticed it.
Why, you can see it the moment she comes into the room!"</p>

<p>"Really?" came the other detached voice. "How quaint!... Who do you
think she's after? Not the Baboon?..."</p>

<p>I imagined the chuckle I didn't hear. I took it that the Baboon was
myself.</p>

<p>"Mandrill, my dear," Miss Windus corrected. "You really must take a
memory powder!..."</p>

<p>"Oh, I call it baboon," Miss Causton remarked with indifference. Then
she laughed.... "How ridiculous you are! He's as big as a man ought to
be anyway&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, quite!"</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;and I declare you can look at him till he's quite good-looking!"</p>

<p>"Oh!..." (I could almost see Miss Windus' quizzical eyes.)</p>

<p>"Really, you are absurd!..."</p>

<p>There was another short silence.</p>

<p>"And by the way," Miss Windus next said, "<i>he's</i> been
rather&mdash;different somehow&mdash;lately, don't you think?"</p>

<p>Sweets crunched for a moment, then:</p>

<p>"Different?... Do you mean <i>he's</i> been looking at you in
that&mdash;ahem!&mdash;dreadful way?"</p>

<p>"What, <i>that</i> creature!..."</p>

<p>"Beg yours, dear&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> should think so!... But I fancied he'd been somehow&mdash;not quite
the same&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, anything for a change, as the song says. Myself, if I found I
couldn't get along without 'em, I should prefer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But a "Sssh!" interrupted Miss Causton. Somebody had come into the
farther bay, and the rest for a time was whispering.</p>

<p>When next the conversation became audible its tenor did not seem to
have changed.</p>

<p>"Scented soap in a little celluloid box, too!" Miss Windus admired.</p>

<p>"One must keep oneself clean," Miss Causton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> threw off. "Have some of
this, dear. I simply had to have some chocolate nougat to-night!..."</p>

<p>There was a rustling of tissue paper.</p>

<p>"Well, it's a sign, and so's her hair-waving and polishing her nails
and that lace yoke," Miss Windus resumed.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, the pneumonia blouse&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>And</i> her heels&mdash;<i>and</i> a scent-sachet!..."</p>

<p>You see that I was quite deliberately listening. I am not putting on
any airs about it. I might have been Polwhele. I wanted to know, so I
listened. I did more than listen too. I watched. I knew that the
shelves were only half full on the other side; only a screen of stout
wire separated the books facing one way from those facing the other;
and by pulling out a book or two on my side I should probably find a
peephole.... Very softly I pulled three or four out, found my opening
and looked. Miss Causton appeared to be standing with her back towards
me; I couldn't see her; but I could see Miss Windus, sitting on the
library ladder holding its short staff, with her plaid skirt pulled
tightly about one carrot-shaped thigh.</p>

<p>They began to talk again.</p>

<p>"And another thing that makes me <i>quite</i> sure, dear! She's going to
young Merridew's next week-end!"</p>

<p>"Oh!..."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't be absurd. You know what I mean. To his parents', of course;
they live in Guildford.... Not that <i>she</i> told me, oh no! Not her
ladyship!"</p>

<p>"Who did, then?"</p>

<p>"Not her, though I gave her <i>every</i> chance! Six months ago she'd have
told me like a shot, but we're getting so blessed artful these
days!... He told me."</p>

<p>"Then it doesn't look as if it <i>was</i> the Baboon?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I daresay she'll leave you your Baboon if you want him."</p>

<p>"Thanks. I think I should know which way to turn in <i>that</i> case," Miss
Causton replied evenly. "Coming?"</p>

<p>And they left the bay together.</p>

<p>It was by this admirable piece of Rixon Tebb &amp; Masters' work that I
learned what, it appeared, I had been watching too closely to see.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p><br></p>
<h3>VI</h3>

<p>I had intended in any case to spend the remainder of that evening with
Archie Merridew. Mingled with my restlessness there had been a
tremulous sensitiveness that had culminated half-an-hour before in a
fit of satanic pride. Lately (I had decided) it had come to be taken
rather too much as a matter of course that our frequent adjournments
after the evening class should be always to his quarters and never, or
hardly ever, to mine. I had quite enough to bear without further
gratuitous rubs of that kind, and I had resolved that I would make
myself his host that evening though he had lived in a mansion and I in
a sty.</p>

<p>But after what I had so altogether discreditably overheard now I had
fifty other reasons for wishing him to come along with me. Almost
every sentence that had been spoken on the other side of that bay of
books had contained a reason. But I realised that before I could trust
myself to face him I must swallow the anger that crowded thickly into
my throat. There was nothing to gain and everything to lose by letting
him see my rage. So I walked back into the empty senior classroom,
there to remain until I should have got the worst of it over.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>By half-past nine I had got myself in hand. I gathered my work
together. Students were coming to the row of washbowls in the small
compartment at the end of the senior classroom to wash their hands,
and Evie gave me the smile that was to be my nourishment for three
whole days as she passed with her towel and the cake of soap in the
new celluloid box. Archie had been working all the evening in the
typewriting-room; now was my chance, before he could make (supposing
him to want to make) any appointment with her, to secure this myself,
and I hurried for my hat and coat and sought him.</p>

<p>"Ready?" I said.</p>

<p>"Right-oh; just a minute," he replied. "I told 'em to keep my fire
in&mdash;I'm going to swot like blazes to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh no&mdash;you're coming along with me this time," I laughed. "I shall be
ashamed to show my face at your place much oftener ... unless," I
added lest he should shake me off, "you love me merely for what I
have&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He laughed too. He was at the young and squab-like stage that takes a
pride in scorning appearances, and even finds the heart more rather
than less honest when the waistcoat over it is shabby. He accepted
with quite a good grace, got his hat and coat, and we went out
together, I giving Miss Windus an unimpeachable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> "Good-night" as I
passed her, hardly a yard from the spot where I had peeped on her less
than an hour before.</p>

<p>The electrograph opposite my abode was an advertisement of "<i>Sarcey's
Fluid</i>," some sort of a disinfectant; and as we approached it Archie
looked up.</p>

<p>"Phew!... Needs it rather, to-night, doesn't it?" he laughed.</p>

<p>It did not seem to me to "need it" quite so badly that evening as it
had on some other evenings&mdash;warm summer evenings, for example&mdash;I had
known. December had come in rawly, and the chestnut stoves and
baked-potato engine were out. The poorer streets have no pleasanter
smell than that of baked potatoes, broken up, sprinkled with salt from
the big tin caster, and closed together again like a South Sea face
with a mealy smiling mouth, and I had slipped a couple of these into
my pocket for our supper. I suppose Archie meant the fried fish papers
in the gutters and (as we entered by my side door) the acrid smell of
the public-house; but it was part of my fiendish pride to rub those
things in a little that evening, and I made light of them as we
mounted the stairs.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're pampered, Master Archie," said I. "I had thought of asking
you round to supper next Saturday evening&mdash;not to-morrow, a week
to-morrow&mdash;but I think I shall save my hospitality."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>You see what I was already angling for. Well, I caught my fish. Of
course he couldn't take Evie down to his folks at Guildford without my
knowing of it, but I wanted to see the fashion in which he would make
his avowal. We had left the carpeted corner of the stairs that the
great ornamental public-house lamp illuminated brightly and were
standing on the bare landing outside my room. He answered without an
instant's hesitation.</p>

<p>"Afraid you'll have to, Jeff&mdash;twice over," he replied. "I've got to go
down home that week-end; beastly nuisance! I was going with some
fellows over to Richmond&mdash;stag-party; but the mater writes that she's
asked Miss Soames, so I suppose I shall have to be there to help
out&mdash;confound it!"</p>

<p>I opened my door and let him into the red and green.</p>

<p>"Oh?" I remarked casually. "Nice change for you. You'll be all the
fitter for the exams. Don't tell <i>me</i> about your stag-parties though.
I know 'em; you'd take jolly good care not to pick the place with the
plainest waitresses for tea, what? <i>I</i> know you!... But if I were you
I'd go steady for a week or two, my boy, that Method paper'll be
harder than you think, I warn you!"</p>

<p>"I'm watching it!" he replied cheerfully. "By Jove! Jeff, I'd
forgotten what a noisy pitch this of yours is! What on earth makes you
stay here?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," I replied carelessly, applying a match to the wick
of my lamp and replacing the chimney. "As I say, you're pampered. The
place is all right. I don't do much except sleep here. It's a bit
cold, though. I'd keep my coat on if I were you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't be much sleep for me here," he remarked, sitting on the edge
of my bed. "I should want a good stiff drink before I slept much in
this racket!"</p>

<p>As I placed the lamp globe on its brass ring I glanced covertly at
him. It was a green interval, and his face looked as if he stood by a
chemist's window near the big pear-shaped green globe, while his
waistcoat was turned to a black purple, with one brass button gleaming
green as a cat's eye. Then the red came again, and the lamp flame
crept up. I went to the little cupboard where I kept my few cups and
saucers and plates. I filled my kettle at the tap on the landing, put
it on the half-crown oil-stove, and began to prepare our feast.</p>

<p>In a quarter of an hour it was ready&mdash;tea, the baked potatoes, and a
wedge of butter apiece. We ate it, he sitting on my bed, I in my
sagging and string-mended old wicker chair. I saw quite plainly that
already he wanted to be off, and would stay no longer than the barest
decency demanded; but he had got to eat that pauper's meal before I
let him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> go, and there were my forty-nine other reasons for having got
him up there.</p>

<p>One of these other reasons had, during the last hour, taken complete
shape in my mind. Its consequences would have been impossible to
foresee, but as far as it yet went, I thought it crafty enough. I
filched another look at him; he was burning the roof of his mouth with
hot potato as he lolled against my bed foot; and I judged it time to
put my plan into execution.</p>

<p>I pushed my own plate away and sank back into my lifeless old wicker
chair. He had turned his coat collar up by this time. My plan kept me
warm.</p>

<p>"You're a lucky beggar, you know, Archie," I sighed heavily.</p>

<p>He had moved, to set down his cup of untasted tea on the floor. He
looked up.</p>

<p>"How?" he asked.</p>

<p>I settled myself farther back.</p>

<p>"How!" I repeated almost vindictively. "Don't you call it lucky having
a house and people and so on?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Everybody has&mdash;&mdash;" he began, but corrected himself. "I mean, I
thought you meant some special luck!"</p>

<p>"Oh no&mdash;just that," I murmured. "Having a place to ask people down to
when you want&mdash;that's all."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>He seemed surprised. "Do you mean Miss Soames?" he said.</p>

<p>"Miss&mdash;&mdash;?" I shook my head absently. "Oh no, I wasn't thinking of
Miss Soames&mdash;I was thinking of something quite different."</p>

<p>He meditated for a moment.</p>

<p>"You <i>have</i> seemed a bit different lately.... What's up?" he demanded,
looking squarely at me.</p>

<p>My plan, to which his last words gave a new and unexpected fillip, was
briefly this:</p>

<p>When, over the case of reference books, I had heard Miss Windus make
the very remark he also had just made&mdash;namely, that I had been
"different"&mdash;I had had a swift access of alarm. In what particular I
had betrayed myself I didn't know, but I realised very clearly, and
doubly clearly now that the same remark had dropped from Archie
himself, that love and a light cannot be hid, and that if my extreme
former care had not secured me from remark no care I was likely to be
able to take for the future would do so. I had laid myself open, and
should do so again. How was I to cover myself?</p>

<p>I thought I saw my way. I invite you to consider that way.</p>

<p>Were I to give it out to Archie&mdash;or rather, not so much to give it out
as allow a surmise to dawn on him&mdash;that my heart was already
pre-engaged in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> some carefully unspecified quarter or other, not only
would this "difference," both he and Miss Windus had remarked on, be
admitted and accounted for, but I should at one stroke set myself free
from a hundred other trammels of gossip, past, present and to come.
After that avowal nothing I did would be unaccountable. I should have
a definite place in the general sex-understanding. I should be
classed, out of the running, filed and docketed, totally uninteresting
to either Miss Windus or Miss Causton and rid of the attentions of
Miss Levey.</p>

<p>And I should also&mdash;my heart had thrilled suddenly and poignantly as I
thought of this&mdash;I should also be admitted at once to privileges. I
should have my share in such freedoms and exemptions as the married
man knows fully and the attached bachelor at least to a probationary
extent. This state of things does by tacit acknowledgment exist. The
man who can say all to one woman can say more than other men to all
women. And the shining immunity I now saw before me would even include
what so far I had had to deny myself&mdash;conversation, thus safeguarded,
with Evie herself.</p>

<p>"By heaven!" my heart now cried within me, "I will do it!"</p>

<p>And instantly a perfect seething of the cautions and reserves with
which I must do it sprang up in my brain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>But here was Archie patiently waiting for me to speak.</p>

<p>"What's up? What the dickens are you talking about?" he asked once
more.</p>

<p>I let my head drop, as a man might who discovers he has said too much.
"Oh, nothing," I replied.</p>

<p>Archie was just as sharp as&mdash;neither more nor less than&mdash;I wished him
to be.</p>

<p>"A lot of fuss about nothing&mdash;if it's really nothing," he said
suspiciously.</p>

<p>The next moment he had looked hard into my face, taken a long breath,
and, suddenly bringing his hand down on his thigh, broken into loud
laughter.</p>

<p>"By Jove! Jeff&mdash;I really believe&mdash;let's have a look at you&mdash;by Jove! I
really do&mdash;<i>I believe you're in love</i>! What a&mdash;&mdash;How ripping, I mean!
Best congratulations, old chap&mdash;my turn this time&mdash;ha ha ha ha!"</p>

<p>I drew myself heavily up. The kind of thing I was doing has to be done
rather carefully. "Look here, Archie&mdash;" I began, trembling between the
wrath I felt and the not-too-much wrath I must appear to display; but
he interrupted me:</p>

<p>"Well, that's a knock-out! Who'd have dreamed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why not?" I demanded sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't mean that!" he made such haste to say that it was plain
as a pikestaff that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> meant precisely "that."</p>

<p>"I only meant, how surprising&mdash;how unexpected. I mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I frowned. "<i>Should</i> you find it so&mdash;if it <i>were</i> so?"</p>

<p>"Should!" he said, puzzled. "... Isn't it so, Jeff?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied; but a "No" that so exquisitely contradicted itself
that I gave myself nothing less than admiration for the performance.</p>

<p>"No?" he echoed. "You're lying, Jeff&mdash;you <i>are</i>!" he broke out
triumphantly. "I can tell by the way you say it! So <i>that's</i> it!
Dashed if I didn't think there was something!... Who is she, Jeff?"</p>

<p>But that, as you may suppose, it was no part of my plan to tell.</p>

<p>Neither was it part of that plan to enjoin either secrecy or the other
thing upon him. That, I thought grimly, might quite safely be left to
take care of itself. "Mandrill, my dear; you really must take a memory
powder!..." I seemed to hear Miss Windus' voice again over the
bookshelves. Oh yes, if he would give currency to that Zoo nonsense he
could be trusted not to keep the richer joke, of Jeffries in love, to
himself!</p>

<p>For that he and not Evie had been responsible for this pleasantry at
the expense of my appearance I had concluded by a much sounder
process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> of observation and reasoning than that my love-lorn state
predisposed me entirely in her favour. My watching, a failure in other
respects, had at least succeeded in this respect. And that I had found
had not been without its barb for me. You may remember my former
pathetic gratitude that, while others singled me out for marked
treatment, she alone had not, in the trifling forms and observances
that are the gracious outside of intercourse as distinct from its
inner truth, differentiated me from the rest of the world. Well, I had
made a guess at the reason for that. It was, in a word, her
upbringing. The aunt with whom she lived in Woburn Place had taught
her to "behave nicely," and so on. I could see that education. Such
maxims as that one must not "judge by appearances," that "handsome is
that handsome does," and, generally speaking, the unexceptional
tradition that the "less fortunately circumstanced" have special
claims on superior gentleness and pity, form almost the whole of it.
I, it appeared, was one of these "less fortunately circumstanced"....
Of course nobody was to blame. By-and-by the amiable aunt would
probably go a little further, and teach her that it is not enough that
these unimpeachable precepts should be merely observed, but that the
thought behind them must be concealed as well. When you treat a poor
devil just as if he was anybody else you must not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> let it be seen that
you do so from perception that he is not.... Anyway, there it was, and
it rather took the shine out of that "good-night, Mr Jeffries" that
had sent me off happy to Archie's rooms on the evening when I had been
so startlingly shaken out of my fool's paradise.</p>

<p>Thus I was persuaded, and as it turned out quite rightly, that it had
been young Merridew, and not she, who had allowed his tongue this
licence both on Weston's physical characteristics and my own.</p>

<p>His cup of tea was still on the floor, and by this time was cold. He
hadn't tasted it, and, his renewed congratulations on what he supposed
to be my blissful state of mind over, was once more fidgeting to be
off. But it was quite at my own pleasure whether I released him or
not; I had the hateful advantage of my baked potatoes and my poverty;
and though he was getting colder moment by moment, being less
accustomed to the lack of a fire than I, I did not spare him.</p>

<p>"Yes," I remarked musingly by-and-by, as if I had been thinking over a
former remark, "I'd take that Method paper quite seriously if I were
you. Save up your little fling till that's over. Stag-parties and work
don't go together, my son."</p>

<p>He had a little gleam of perspicacity. "What little fling?" he asked.
"Who said I was going to have one?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>("Carefully, Jeffries," I cautioned myself.) Aloud I said cheerfully,
"My mistake, Archie&mdash;I'm out of the running in these things&mdash;I'm
rather a Puritan by necessity, you see. Perhaps I was taking it rather
for granted&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He chuckled. "A Puritan by necessity! A Puritan by Miss
Whatever-her-name-is, more like! Do at least tell us if it's anybody
we know, Jeff!"</p>

<p>But I ignored the latter part of his remark. "Well done, Archie," I
applauded. "I'm glad you see that when a man's got one woman he's no
need for all the others. Stick to that and you're all right."</p>

<p>And that clinched it. "Well, you've got the pull over me there," he
said.</p>

<p>I made no reply.</p>

<p>You need not conclude, unless you wish, that I wanted to start him
straight away to the devil. I couldn't have ensured his arrival at
that destination if I had. But I was prepared to go half way with him
if by so doing I could keep him from getting into paradise by the
means I had reserved for myself. I was doing him no conspicuous harm.
He would have to rub shoulders with the world before long&mdash;was already
doing so; and I said no more to him&mdash;nay, I said far less&mdash;than he
would have picked up for himself in almost any gathering of young men
of his own age that he was likely to find himself among.... So
presently, when after (how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> shall I put it?)&mdash;after having tapped it
home that there <i>was</i> the one woman and also the others, I returned to
the examination in Method again, I was talking as easily as if, his
betrayals to Miss Windus notwithstanding, we had been the best friends
in the world.</p>

<p>"By the way, that's another thing you're lucky in, my boy," I said.
"The exam's in the daytime. I suppose that doesn't convey anything to
you."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, it means something to me. I shall have to get a day off."</p>

<p>"Well?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;it doesn't by any means follow that I shall get it."</p>

<p>He stared. "You don't mean to say they'd be such skunks as not to let
you off for a day!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>I laughed. "Perhaps they won't be such skunks," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he cried, outraged. "They <i>couldn't</i>!"</p>

<p>He was as ignorant about Rixon Tebb &amp; Masters as he was about
everything else in life.</p>

<p>Presently, with a "Brrr!" and a shiver, he got off my bed.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm off," he said. "I didn't intend to come round, and I'm
going back to swot."</p>

<p>I heaved myself up from my chair. "Must you?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> Well, wait a
moment&mdash;I'll come down with you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Before I turned down my lamp, filling the room with the red and green
again, I noticed his untouched cup of tea on the floor. I made no
remark on it, but as I preceded him down the narrow stairs I found
myself suddenly filled with a curiosity as to whether I guessed
rightly what was passing in his mind. I had made my shot, and was as
interested to know whether it was a true one as if I had had a bet on
it.</p>

<p>Where the great public-house lamp shone brightly through the landing
window the stairs branched, one flight descending to the side door by
which we had entered and the other leading to the back bar of the
public-house. It was as we reached this bifurcation that I found I had
guessed rightly.</p>

<p>"I say," he said, "I'm beastly cold! Come this way and have a drink!"</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>"Not here," I said. "Not on my own premises, so to speak. If you don't
mind my having something thin I'll come over the way with you."</p>

<p>"Anywhere," he said, with another shiver.</p>

<p>There was another public-house just beyond the <i>Sarcey's Fluid</i>
advertisement. We crossed and entered it.</p>

<p>"Rum&mdash;hot!" he called familiarly, peering under the frame of pivoted
glass panes and flipping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> on the counter with a florin to attract the
barmaid's attention. "Come along, Flossie&mdash;hurry up!... What's your
poison, Jeff?"</p>

<p>He had his rum hot; but I drank nothing stronger than peppermint.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p><br></p>
<h3>VII</h3>

<p>His incredible gaucheries apart, I had no reason for hating him. One
does not hate a youngster seven years one's junior merely because he
is a mass of inexperience and self-sufficiency. Once again my hate was
really a hatred of the whole dreary circumstances of my life, and,
when I saw this concentrating stormily over young Merridew's head, I
made attempt after attempt to divert it. I swear to you I made these
attempts. I made them first of all to save him from a contest so
unequal as one with my wrath must be; and if I made them later so that
I myself should not be merely the slave of that wrath, I still made
them. And all the time, as I say, so long as he did not stand in my
way, it was a matter of indifference to me whether he took the upward
path or that which led downhill to perdition.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I was in love, and no man in love can stand by the rules
that he knows ought to govern his conduct. Those jealousies I have
spoken of as torturing me at Rixon Tebb &amp; Masters' shook me in spite
of myself. When I felt their approach I took care to give young
Merridew a wide berth; and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> confess that in sometimes letting these
fits have their way with me I found an abominable ease. Away from him,
my heart was filled with rage and revilings; but these very outbreaks
enabled me at other times to meet him with a smile on my lips and a
welcome in my eyes. Once I had got rid of the over-plus of my rage I
could almost have persuaded myself of my affection for him.</p>

<p>So I alternated, as the red and green of my apartment alternated; and
perhaps the red seemed redder and the green greener by the mere force
of the contrast. I continued to walk home frequently with him after
the class, to share his supper frequently, and to be obliged to him
for my necessary bath.</p>

<p>I very soon learned that in the matter of my reputed being in love he
had done exactly what I had intended he should do&mdash;had whispered the
news about the college. It required no further eavesdropping to tell
me that; I felt it in the altered air. I saw the knowledge peering
through the little scalene triangles of Miss Windus' eyes, saw it in
the looks of sleepy and amused curiosity with which Miss Causton
favoured me. The latter lady, indeed, sometimes positively alarmed me,
for the glances I suffered when I chanced to enter a room in which she
was at work held incalculable things, and I no longer dared to look at
her own amused and supercilious eyes, her fascinating hands, or that
foot beneath the hem of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> her dress, fine and slender as a violin. And
with the least encouragement Miss Windus would, I knew, have sought my
company, and, lacking an admirer of her own, would have eased her
breast to somebody else's of all the things about love at large that
she ached to say to somebody. I wondered, seeing them both, whether
there was no middle way with women. The whole sex seemed to be divided
into creatures (or rather a creature, for I set Evie apart) to be
enskied by men, and the other kind, that a man might fly as he would
fly a wild animal. And I am not sure even now that when these two
things are found in one and the same woman they ever really shake down
together. They seem to go on existing, independently, unreconciled,
side by side.</p>

<p>But Miss Levey was far worse. She always seemed to me to crave
information, useful or useless, from a mere acquisitiveness; and I may
say now that it was she who, later, first roused in me the uneasy
suspicion that unless I was exceedingly careful I should find that I
had undertaken more than I could well manage. She began all at once to
show quite a liking for my company. She mislaid books in the room
where I sat, got into difficulties with copying presses when I was
about, and glanced up at open or closed windows too high for her
reach, as if she felt a draught or the lack of air, it didn't matter
which, and must suffer until somebody came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> to her help. All this had
its rise in the idlest curiosity, unless, as I sometimes suspected,
she had made a bet that she would get out of me who this imaginary
<i>fiancée</i> of mine was, and was determined to win it. One day as I saw
her struggling with the blind cords in one of the window bays, and
advanced to her assistance, she relinquished the cords, and then, as
if to apologise for the trouble she was causing me, said, "Oh, thank
you so much&mdash;you see I'm going to a dance to-night, and have a slight
cold already.... You don't go to dances, do you, Mr Jeffries?" I
answered that I did not, whereupon she said gaily, "Oh, you must
learn! I'm sure you could find <i>some</i>body who would teach you! Then
you and your partner could join our set&mdash;such fun!"</p>

<p>And another time she actually came to me with tickets for one of her
"hops," and pointed out to me that I should be saving a shilling by
taking both a pink ticket as well as a blue one.</p>

<p>But while these were the results of my whispered false intelligence on
Miss Windus and Miss Causton and Miss Levey, the results on Evie
Soames were both foreseen and unforeseen. I had foreseen that it would
give me a new liberty with her; but I had not foreseen that she, and
not I, would be the first to take advantage of that liberty. It came
to me entirely as a surprise that she should see no reason why, if my
heart was engaged, she should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> not speak of it as a matter of course
to myself.</p>

<p>This, to my great confusion, she did.</p>

<p>It was in the small back room that we called the library, among the
book-shelves and glass-cases of mimeographs and gelatine copiers and
patent tills, that she did so. I had seen her talking to Weston in the
empty lecture-room as I had passed through to restore a book to its
place&mdash;a new translation of "Schmoller on the Mercantile System," I
remember it was&mdash;and she had turned as I had passed. I think she had
been a little nervous about the pretty little exhibition she intended.
It wouldn't surprise me in the least to learn that she had actually
practised the words she was going to use, and I am quite sure she
meant to go through it creditably. My lady was even then looking
forward to the time when, on a small scale or a large one, she would
have to do these things. So she followed me into the library, and,
with one slender hand on the iron ball-arm of the copying press under
the gas said her little piece.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr Jeffries!... I hear I have to congratulate you!"</p>

<p>For a moment I did not take her meaning. Then it dawned on me, and I
felt a quick constriction of my heart that was both bliss and pain.</p>

<p>"Oh?... On&mdash;on what?" I asked. I couldn't help stammering a little
over it.</p>

<p>She wore a brown cloth tailor-made costume and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> a thick knitted cap of
white wool; and the shadow of this cap over her large eyes was not so
deep but that I saw the almost reproachful look in them. It was almost
as if she echoed: "'On what?' Can such a wonderful thing have happened
to you and you ask 'On what?'"</p>

<p>"On this we hear of your engagement," she replied, looking down at her
toes. "It's&mdash;it's true, isn't it?"</p>

<p>For the second time I felt my facile invention sitting somewhat less
easily on me. I stammered again, while she, I am quite sure,
misattributed my embarrassment.</p>

<p>"Who told you that?"</p>

<p>At that she was sweetly arch.</p>

<p>"Oh, a little bird, Mr Jeffries! Don't tell me it isn't true&mdash;it would
be almost&mdash;almost like bad luck&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bad luck?" I repeated foolishly.</p>

<p>"I mean, like wearing your wedding dress before the day, or something
like that&mdash;congratulating you too soon, I mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>By this time I had collected my thoughts. "It isn't true," I said.</p>

<p>Instantly her face fell adorably. In its expression I fancied I
detected both indignation against her misinformant and mortification
that her dear little attempt at social competence had failed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!... I'm <i>so</i> sorry!" she murmured, all dejection and shame and
rich colour. "Please forgive me!"</p>

<p>"It isn't true," I said, "that&mdash;that I am actually engaged to be
married."</p>

<p>Like a flash she was all eagerness again. She had a book in her hand,
not a college text-book but a novelette; and probably the whole of the
novelette was in her glad change of tone. I was not exactly engaged to
be married, but I <i>was</i> in love, and I daresay her brain was already a
jumble of surmises about obstinate parents, secret wills, <i>marriages
de convenance</i>, and true and severed young hearts.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said again. "I'm so&mdash;I mean I hope I shall soon be able
to&mdash;I mean I hope I'm not rude if I&mdash;&mdash;" She floundered, already out
of her depth.</p>

<p>"Not at all," I said gravely. "I only said I was not formally engaged.
There are&mdash;other reasons for congratulation after all&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, then I <i>do</i>!" she cried impulsively, with a grateful look that I
had helped her out. "I'm <i>so</i> glad!"</p>

<p>Then, her ordeal over, she glanced towards the door.</p>

<p>But a daring impulse seized me. This was on a Friday night, and I knew
that on the morrow she was going to Guildford.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"I see you're just leaving," I said. "Would it annoy you if I were to
walk a little way with you?"</p>

<p>Again the code of her upbringing banished her momentary hesitation.</p>

<p>"Unless," I said, "you have already&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh no!" she said, with quick frankness. "I only meant that I nearly
always go alone, or else with Miss Windus."</p>

<p>"I'm sure Miss Windus can spare you for once. One doesn't get
congratulated like this every day," I pressed.</p>

<p>She laughed merrily. "Some of us don't get it at all," she said. "With
pleasure, Mr Jeffries."</p>

<p>I slapped Schmoller back into his place on the shelf, and went off,
drunk with bliss, to get my hat and coat.</p>

<p>That night I walked with Evie for the first time to Woburn Place.
Never had the Bloomsbury streets seemed so short, never the east side
of the British Museum so few paces in length. I remember very little
of what we talked about, I know she spoke of her visit to Guildford.
The invitation, she gave me to understand, was really to her aunt, and
it was to the subject of her aunt that she quickly returned when I
insinuated a mention of Archie's name. I insinuated it again a minute
later, but after that, noticing the way in which she came back to the
aunt again, I forbore.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I'm afraid we can't ask the Merridews back, as we ought," she
said, once more socially prescient. "We only have rooms in Woburn
Place, you see, and you can't very well ask people all that way just
to rooms, can you?"</p>

<p>"No," I replied briefly. I was thinking of my own late hospitality to
Archie.</p>

<p>"We used to have a house, of course, before uncle died, and you know
how poky rooms seem after that."</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, compressing my lips.</p>

<p>And so we chatted. I forget what our other subjects were. I left her,
with our first hand-shake, at her door.</p>

<p>What that week-end was to me I will not attempt to tell you. I did not
belong to this earth at all. The fact that actually, in her person,
she was enjoying herself in Archie's company at Guildford was nothing
to me; the fact that every fibre of me was rapturously tremulous at
the thought of her was everything. I triumphed as if I already had her
yielding in my arms. Archie?... In my possession I laughed. I even
felt kindly to Archie&mdash;felt towards him that it would give me pleasure
to have him, by-and-by, a quite frequent visitor at my house&mdash;our
house.... I spread the mantle of my exaltation over the draymen and
porters of the place where I dined. Their heavens were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> mine, but
if a man is full he is full, and I allowed them sanctities of their
own. My heart was soft and generous to them. For the first time in my
life I knew what folk mean when they say they love all the world.</p>

<p>The sweet influence had not quite left me when on Monday night I went
to the college to see her again.</p>

<p>She did not appear that night. Neither did he.</p>

<p>It was Wednesday before I saw her again.</p>

<p>I do not know what damnable difference in me that absence of the pair
of them for a single evening made. It came over me so suddenly that I
was in its clutches before I was aware. It was a significant
transformation. Let me relate it.</p>

<p>I knocked at the brass knocker of Archie's ivy-green door an hour
before the class on the Tuesday night, and found that he intended to
work at home that evening. (I only learned this, however, some minutes
later.) I had had a double reason for calling on him at that hour, and
the blood comes hot again in my cheeks as I recall my second reason. I
had recently bought a new suit of clothes, not in Lamb's Conduit
Street, but made, though cheaply enough, to measure; and though it was
only the beginning of the week one of the payments for this suit had
already depleted my pocket almost to the last penny. Since breakfast
that day I had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> eaten. But I knew the hour at which Archie dined.</p>

<p>So nicely had I hit the moment for my self-invitation that I actually
followed his hot dinner half-way up the stairs. It was only on the
first landing that the servant stood aside with the tray to allow me
to precede her. I knocked at his door and entered, leaving the door
open for the dinner of which I intended to partake to follow.</p>

<p>He had brought a fowl back with him from Guildford, with one or two
other motherly gifts, and I smelt the white sauce even before Jane put
the tray down on a side table. Archie was in his brown dressing-gown,
standing before his fire. He had taken the green shade from his lamp,
and his low-ceilinged roof-chamber looked exceedingly ruddy and
comfortable and home-like.</p>

<p>"Hallo! Good man!" he cried. "You're just in time&mdash;I was just funking
carving&mdash;you'd better be getting your hand in for when you're a family
man!... Bring another plate, Jane.... Well, how's things?"</p>

<p>It was then that the thing happened that still has power to bring the
blood to my cheeks. It was exquisitely cruel in the moment of its
coming.</p>

<p>"Oh, so-so," I replied carelessly.... "But I've just this minute
swallowed my dinner, thanks. You go ahead. I'll watch you."</p>

<p>"Oh, rubbish!" he replied, in a tone that hardened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> me. "I'll lay you
haven't had so much but you can pick a bit of Surrey fowl."</p>

<p>I damned the thickness of his hide, but swallowed my choler.</p>

<p>"Really, thanks," I said, turning away to look at a print on the wall
that I had seen a hundred times before.</p>

<p>Jane hesitated. It was a long way up from the kitchen, and the old
bell-pull of red rope by his fireplace didn't always ring. "Shall I
bring the other plate, Mr Merridew?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;bring it&mdash;he'll change his mind!"</p>

<p>But in my hellish pride I had now no intention whatever of changing my
mind. Twice again he pressed me, and twice I declined, the second time
curtly; and he fell to himself, while I sat in a chair and watched
him.</p>

<p>"Oh, by the way," he said suddenly, with his mouth full of food, "I'm
going to work here to-night.... Sure you won't have some pudding?"</p>

<p>I rose. "Oh, well, if you're not coming I'll sheer off; why didn't you
say so? Enjoy your week-end?"</p>

<p>"Oh, first rate. But, dash it all, don't be in such a hurry&mdash;you're
far too early yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, I've just remembered something," I said, "See you again soon."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>And I waved my hand and left.</p>

<p>I did not go to the class either that night. I was raging again, and
trying to protect that young fool from the injury of my savage
thoughts. I failed completely. Not even the thought that my passionate
resentment was a force to be confined as it were in a boiler, and only
to be allowed to escape by the way that would prove effective,
restrained me from clenching my fists and gritting my teeth as I
recalled the image of his pretty and ignorant and conceited face; and
I am afraid I "let go" utterly. I walked by way of Chancery Lane and
Bouverie Street to the Embankment; I crossed Blackfriars Bridge, and
after that I don't quite know where I went, trying to forget my
hunger, and trying to shake off my hideous grudge against the world
that threatened to crash over the head of the egotistical
whipper-snapper I had left.</p>

<p>I have related this at some length because it was the first time, but
not the last, that that devil of sensitiveness took me in quite that
way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p><br></p>
<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>I had not exaggerated when I told Archie Merridew that I might find
some difficulty in obtaining from Rixon Tebb &amp; Masters' leave of
absence for the day of the Method examination. That examination was
fixed for a Friday, a fortnight and some days after my refusal to set
fork into that fragrantly steaming Surrey fowl of Archie Merridew's,
and this falling on a Friday added to my difficulties.</p>

<p>Or rather I should say that it added to Polwhele's difficulties, for
it was to Polwhele I looked once more to find a way out for me. For
Friday was a wage-day, and since I must have my eighteen shillings in
order to live, a mere covering of my absence would not suffice. The
cashier would have to be taken into the arrangement.</p>

<p>But Polwhele had by now to some extent got over his dread, if not over
his hatred, of me. When I put the matter to him he refused. This was
in the street, during the luncheon hour. The louse refused to help me,
and turned away.</p>

<p>Exactly fifteen minutes later I had bearded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> cashier himself,
catching him at the door as he was returning from his meal.</p>

<p>At first he looked at me as much as to say, "Did <i>I</i> speak to <i>you"</i>?
Then, finding it impossible to pretend he didn't know who I was, he
said, "What is it?"</p>

<p>I told him what I wanted, concealing only my reason for wanting it;
and, after his first astonishment that I had taken the absolutely
unprecedented course of addressing a request otherwise than through
the usual channel, I found him not unmanageable. As a matter of fact,
things were slack, and there was only one kind of labour that Rixon
Tebb &amp; Masters' would have preferred to that it had from the agency at
eighteen shillings a week&mdash;namely, a "floating margin" waiting on the
pavement to be taken on for an hour or two as it might be required.
Gayns saw a chance of saving a day.</p>

<p>"You don't expect to be paid for that day, do you?" he said.</p>

<p>"No," I replied.</p>

<p>He thought for a moment. "All right," he said. "You can come for your
fifteen shillings on Thursday night."</p>

<p>And Polwhele set another mark against me, that I had approached a
superior over his head.</p>

<p>As I entered the Business College at half-past ten on the morning of
the examination it suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> struck me that I had never been inside
the place in the daytime before. By gaslight it was, as I have said,
dingy enough, but by daylight it was shabby in the extreme. I walked
round the rooms, noticing for the first time that the shorthand and
typewriting rooms, which looked on the side street to the east of the
block, were by far the lightest rooms on our top floor, and that the
library in which I had received Evie's congratulations was little more
than a thick twilight, which the cleaning of the single grimy back
window that looked out over yards and chimney-pots would probably not
greatly have improved. The room adjoining that, the old ledger-room,
was not, except for the small high square of glass that gave on the
head of the stairs, lighted at all.</p>

<p>They had made, too, quite extensive arrangements for the occasion
itself. We had been warned that we should not be allowed to leave the
premises until the examination was over, and as far as possible
separate spaces had been provided for each of the twenty-five
candidates&mdash;compartments of screens hired for the day from some
furnisher or shop-fitter, and open at the ends to the gaze of the
half-dozen perambulating guardians of the probity of examinations who
looked as if they too had been had in for the day on the same terms as
the screens. The contrast between the new fittings and the old
wallpapers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> and chandeliers struck me. And I remembered that even now,
when I had been debited my three shillings to be present, I did not
see the place in its normal daytime aspect at all.</p>

<p>The papers were to be distributed at eleven, and at a few minutes
before that hour we were all assembled. A man called Mackie and myself
were the only two candidates for the Honours paper, and he and I were
kept well apart&mdash;I told off to a seat in the middle of the
lecture-room, he isolated in the typewriting-room. Evie, timorous
about her Elementary, was separated from Archie Merridew (who occupied
the box between Miss Windus and a pale student, Richardson) by the
whole length of the general room. We took our places; in all the rooms
at once voices were heard reading some cautionary form or other (my
policeman gave me the most mistrustful of glances as he pronounced the
words "expelled from the examination-room and your paper cancelled");
the papers were distributed on the stroke of eleven, and the
examination began.</p>

<p>I need not trouble you with what it was all about. The importance of
that day to me was quite unconnected with the paper on Method. I
ought, however, to say that the paper was in reality two papers, the
first in Theory and the second in Practice, with the interval for
lunch dividing the two. I mention this only to explain how it was we
came to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> all talking together when, a little after half-past one,
our first papers had been collected and we were free to unsnap our
satchels or untie our parcels of lunch.</p>

<p>Despite my reduced income that week I had provided myself with a
sumptuous lunch&mdash;two kinds of sausage from a <i>delicatessen</i> shop in
Shaftesbury Avenue, a paper of potato salad, a roll, butter, some sort
of chocolate <i>baba</i> or <i>moka</i>, and a bottle of Schweppes' dry ginger
ale. That lunch had cost me nearly three shillings&mdash;but I intended to
eat only a third of it. The rest was to be my chief sustenance during
the two following days. I was not among my porters and drivers now&mdash;oh
no! I was cutting quite a dash. Archie, passing with Miss Windus as I
opened my black satchel, did not forbear to remark, "By Jove! doesn't
Jeffries do himself well, what?" and it had been in order that I might
be assumed to "do" myself equally well every day of my life that I had
made my little display. I ate my exact third in the same compartment I
had written my examination paper in, and then, closing my bag on the
precious remainder, put it under the seat and mingled with the others.</p>

<p>By a sort of natural selection, I presently found myself in the middle
bow window, discussing the questions he had just answered with my only
fellow-candidate in Honours, Mackie. Mackie, both at the college and
elsewhere, was one of these blatantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> popular chaps, and I myself
didn't like him. In some respects he was rather of Archie's kind, but
he was older, more knowing, and had gone further. He was a singer of
comic songs at "smokers," and a frequent looker-in at the shilling
dances at the Holburn Town Hall after class. He was jubilant over the
ease of the Theory paper, and was already so confident of his pass
that he was cracking jokes right and left, as if a weight had been
taken off his mind.</p>

<p>"It's going to be like money from home if it's no harder than that!"
he exulted (almost prophetically, if what I said about the standard of
modern examinations is true). "Kitty Windus says she'll eat her
mackintosh, with the accent on the 'tosh,' if she isn't all right for
the Advanced, and the Elementaries are as safe as your hand in your
pocket! What ho! Come out on the stairs and have a Flor de Cabbagos."</p>

<p>I didn't want the Flor de Cabbagos, but I went out on the top landing
with him. One or two others were smoking on the floor below, which was
as far as we were allowed to stray. A few steps down Miss Windus and
Miss Causton were sitting on the stairs, as if they were sitting out a
dance, and Miss Causton moved lower down still as the fragrance of
Mackie's "Flor" reached her, and then a little way back again as she
caught the whiff that came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> up the well. Mackie was talking of the
paper again.</p>

<p>"All that mugging for a job you could do on your head!" he said, with
regret for the time he had lost. "I wouldn't have dropped out of the
billiard handicap if I'd known! Play billiards, Jeffries? I'm a
regular John Roberts&mdash;in my dreams. Give you fifty in a hundred at the
Napier when teacher says we can go."</p>

<p>And he ran on, with dull facetiousness.</p>

<p>But suddenly he stopped his rapid flow. He made a slight movement with
his finger, and stood listening. I heard nothing except the voices
lower down the stairs and the general hum in the room we had just
left. But Mackie did.</p>

<p>"Hear that?" he said.</p>

<p>"What?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Sssh!..."</p>

<p>I told you how the wooden partition at the head of the stairs, that
with the small window high up, separated the landing on which we stood
from the old ledger-room. The window was worked with cords on a
horizontal pivot, and was swung partly open. Whether Mackie heard
whatever he did hear through this window or through the boards
themselves I do not know, but a smile came over his face.</p>

<p>"It's that young devil," he whispered.</p>

<p>"Who?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, young Merridew. He's in there with somebody...."</p>

<p>I invite you to notice that I was improving. I was not eavesdropping
this time&mdash;I was merely letting Mackie do my eavesdropping for me. He
glanced round to see whether the women below were watching, and then
set his ear against the partition.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's Merridew," he chuckled. "Nice father's hope and mother's
joy <i>that</i> young man's getting! I don't suppose he's gone in there to
talk to the secretary bird!..."</p>

<p>I found myself suddenly reminded of what I had noticed for the first
time only an hour or two before&mdash;that the room beyond the partition
was practically unlighted.</p>

<p>Then Mackie dropped again into the "bright" style affected by the
singers of comic songs at smoking concerts.</p>

<p>"Ahem&mdash;good-hevening, ladies and gen'lmen! How am I? Very well,
thank me! Ahem! I will now, with your kind permission, endeavour to
entertain you with a few of my well-known impersonations on a
subject that will appeal to all of you, no matter what your age,
sex, condition, vaccination marks or the number of your dog
licence&mdash;<i>London's Lovers</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr Mackie's going to recite for us!" I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> heard Miss Windus' cry of
juvenile delight from down the stairs. "Please be quick, Mr Mackie&mdash;we
shall have to go in in ten minutes!"</p>

<p>And those below pressed up the stairs to hear Mackie.</p>

<p>But I did not stay to hear the "impersonation." I walked back into the
general room, and, with a violently throbbing heart, sought the seat
where I had written my examination paper.</p>

<p>Do you realise what I had just seen? Do you see what had set my heart
so thumping? If Mackie was right, and he had really got the cue for
his "impersonation" from something that was going on in the
ledger-room, young Merridew and Evie were alone in there together.</p>

<p>All that I had hitherto known of apprehension and despair and jealousy
of Archie's luck and chances and juniority was eclipsed by the emotion
that now flowed over me like a wave. The revelation swept me entirely
off my balance. It seemed to me that once more I awoke as if out of a
dream. I seemed to be standing as it were a little way off from my own
baseless hopes and illusions of the past weeks and coldly
contemplating my own egregiousness. I actually gave out loud a low
laugh that harrowed myself. What! To suppose that all, all I could do,
would prevent youth from coming together at the last!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>So I made myself a spectacle of ridicule for myself.</p>

<p>Then, as the minutes passed, that which at first had seemed a pure and
perfect whole of hopelessness changed subtly and began to separate
into parts. And that brought such a change in me that I trembled to
recognise it. The shock of those first moments had stunned me, but I
was now coming out of my stupor. My first swift conclusion had been
wrong. These were <i>not</i> young lovers whom mountains could not sunder.
She, my sleeping beauty, who had but now opened her eyes, no doubt
thought I was that; her soul was over-brimming; and I remembered her
look of wonder and reproach when, after she had congratulated me on
that love-rise that is the most wondrous of earthly dawnings I had
given a puzzled "on what?" When hearts can no longer contain that with
which they ache to bursting, lucky is the one who stands nearest to
hand. His it is to have, for the lifting of his finger, what else
would spill. He may not be athirst for the draught; a muddier liquor
might quench his fire as well; but this dew and ichor is his, though
another parch for it.</p>

<p>For I needed no pointers from Mackie to know young Archie now. This
was his ignored and heaven-high luck, and he did not even want it. If
their being together in that unlighted room&mdash;their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> being together
even as I sat with my head between my hands staring blankly at the
yellow deal screen&mdash;if this meant anything at all it meant one thing
and one thing only, that she must give because it was her nature to
give, and the cub was philandering with her.</p>

<p>At that thought my despair gave place to something else. It was eaten
up in the white flame of wrath that flashed like a brand in my brain.</p>

<p>"Oh!" I thought. "So <i>that's</i> it, my Archie?..."</p>

<p>I need not tell you again how I always have made my angers serviceable
to me. Five minutes later&mdash;though my will was well-nigh deracinated in
the process&mdash;I was its master again. It still struggled like a beast
in my hold, nor did I know whence the help could come without which it
would presently have me in its power again, but I still retained my
throttling hold on it. One last wild struggle the beast made; this was
when beyond the end of my screen-enclosed compartment, I saw them
issue, with an interval of half-a-minute between their coming out of
the library doorway. He was pink and triumphant; at her I forbore to
look. A minute later Mackie passed and gave an infinitesimally small
jerk of his head and a wink; but by that time I was holding my savage
beast down again.</p>

<p>Then a bell rang; there was a buzz and movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> the candidates were
making ready again. Once more attendants read the caution, and then
the second paper was distributed. Mechanically I turned over the
gelatine-copied leaves that had been handed to me.</p>

<p>But I pushed them away again. A man who is engaged as I still was&mdash;a
luckless hunter who has missed his shot and is struggling desperately
body to body with his intended prey&mdash;has little time for anything but
the business in hand. True, I did draw the paper to me again and tick
off the questions that would be productive of the highest marks, but
it was long before I got any further. There would come between me and
my page Archie Merridew's pink and boastful face as I had seen him
issue from the library door.</p>

<p>I do not know how long I sat thus.</p>

<p>Draggingly at last I settled to work. But it was well-nigh hopeless. I
came to myself after a long interval to find that I was staring
blankly before me and muttering softly to myself. I had not written
more than half-a-page. Wearily I tried again.</p>

<p>The next external thing that I was fully awake to was that from the
typewriting-room there came the single "Ting" of the small clock on
the mantelpiece. I started. That single "Ting" always meant one of
two things&mdash;one o'clock or a half-hour. I had no watch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>I tried for a moment to persuade myself that the clock had just struck
half-past two.</p>

<p>Then I heard the attendant's voice: "You have one hour left."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" I groaned.</p>

<p>I drew my paper to me again.</p>

<p>For a time I was not conscious of anything but the questions that must
be answered by half-past four. Indeed, so feverishly did I work that I
did not hear the attendants announce that we had only half-an-hour
longer. The next announcement I heard was that fifteen minutes only
remained.</p>

<p>Swiftly and flurriedly I turned over what I had written. I was just
half-way through the paper.</p>

<p>Wildly alarmed, I broke into rapid shorthand&mdash;the shorthand in which I
am writing this now. I did not know whether the shorthand would be
accepted; I only knew that in its larger aspect the object of the
examination was to determine whether I was master of my subject. I was
master of my subject. Those already diluted tests of capacity, the
questions, dictated their own replies: I put on top speed.</p>

<p>"You have five minutes more," sounded the relentless voice.</p>

<p>But I could have sworn that not one minute elapsed before, much louder
and more peremptory, came the final call:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"You must now cease writing!"</p>

<p>As I mingled with my fellow-candidates again I heard Mackie crying
joyously, "Oh, we got medals for this in Paris!" But I passed him by
without a glance. Nor had I any desire to linger about those premises
my first sight of which in the daytime had cost me three shillings in
cash, and a murderous rage that might indeed have closed the gates of
heaven in my face. I went quickly for my hat and coat, almost
colliding with Miss Causton as I turned a corner and muttering I know
not what as she shrank back and gave me a look that I could hardly
reconcile with her usually ironical and ruminating eyes. I merely
wanted to get out of the place....</p>

<p>But I did not escape so quickly but that I saw Archie and Evie
following me down the stairs. No doubt they were going together to her
aunt's to tea.</p>

<p>A week later I learned that I had passed with distinction in the
Theory part of the paper, but had failed in the Practice portion. The
examiners made a joke about "Paper Number Two," saying they had
decided to hold it over for next year's shorthand examination.
Everybody knew whose paper Number Two was....</p>

<p>Mackie had passed in both portions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="I" id="I"></a>I</h3>

<p>Some time or other during the period of my engagement to Miss Windus
(an episode of my history I am now approaching), I happened to remark
on the pleasant arrangement that had removed many of the temptations
of London from Archie Merridew's path by giving him a "home from
home"&mdash;the wholesome influence of the Soames' house in Woburn Place.
My charmer agreed with me that no arrangement could have been happier.
It is of that arrangement that I must now speak. But first I must tell
you as much as I can recollect of the party with which the Christmas
term closed.</p>

<p>Little as things of that kind appeal to me, I had been to that
breaking-up party. Why I had deliberately sought this misery I find it
difficult to say. It had been Miss Levey who, the very evening before
the result of the Method examination had been announced, had broached
the matter to me, and that of itself would doubtless have decided me
had it not been for Miss Causton, who had come up just as I was
refusing.</p>

<p>"Mr Jeffries says he won't come!" Miss Levey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> had said, turning to
Miss Causton, "but we want a few of the seniors as guests&mdash;you and Mr
Mackie and Mr Weston&mdash;you're the lights of the college, you know."</p>

<p>I had been quite unaware that my mental comment on her "we" had shown
in my face (she was quite twenty-five), but apparently it had, for she
had added, with a laugh that had struck me as contemptuous even of
herself, "Oh, I call myself a junior too!" and had turned away.</p>

<p>Of course I ought not to have gone, and, after I had learned of my
failure in Method, I had been on the point of renewing my refusal. But
then there had seized me an almost mad desire to see how much I really
could endure with a smile (Evie and Archie, of course, had been among
the first to accept). So the very thing that ought to have kept me
away had driven me there. Of this extreme of perversity I am afraid I
must ask you to find what explanation you can. I am merely setting
down the thing as it occurred.</p>

<p>So I had gone, though, to Miss Levey's disappointment, <i>sans</i> "lady,"
and had had, moreover, the pleasure, such as it was, of also
disappointing those who had expected that my failure in Method would
plunge me into gloom. I was far beyond gloom. Mere gloom would not
have expressed my feelings; it would have lacked the ecstasy of my
misery. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> I daresay I had appeared, not less, but more cheerful than
my ordinary, and perhaps that was even set down as courage that was
merely the numbing of sensibility.</p>

<p>A most extraordinary experience to me that party had been. On the
occasion of the Method examination screens and tables had had to be
imported, but this time the opposite had been done, and all day
half-a-dozen of the students had been busy, stacking desks and tables
away in the old ledger-room and clearing the lecture-room for dancing.
The senior classroom had been turned into a refreshment-room, and an
upright piano had been got in and lifted upon Weston's lecturing dais.
Blackboards indicated the way to the ladies' cloak-room (the library)
and that of the men (the room with the washbowls), and by the time I
had arrived, at half-past eight, everybody had assembled. Nine had
been fixed as the hour when dancing was to begin.</p>

<p>Sisters and friends had brought up the number of women to perhaps a
dozen, and Miss Levey had not failed to remark on my coming alone. Her
short legs had started to bring her to me almost before I had looked
about me.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr Jeffries&mdash;then you <i>haven't</i> brought a lady friend!" she had
reproached me. "I hope you understood that the invite was for two!" At
this, setting my face into a rocky smile that had remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> on it
thence forward, I had looked at her over her fan.</p>

<p>"Oh?" I had said. "Then it was my 'lady friend,' not me, you wanted to
see?"</p>

<p>But she had been equal to me. "Oh no&mdash;but there are three times as
many gentlemen as ladies, you know. Come and let me introduce you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But I had evaded this, preferring, in the words of Mackie, who had
passed just then, to "paper the wall."</p>

<p>From my station by the thrown-back folding-doors of the lecture-room,
with that carved smile on my face for all the world as if my heart had
been temporarily atrophied, I had been able to look even on Evie
almost unmoved. The whole scene had been a haggard but quite painless
nightmare to me. When, at nine o'clock, the piano had begun to play, I
had watched the men in their black sparrow-tails and white gloves,
stooping, posturing, offering arms, revolving, as if the picture had
been a flat representation, lacking a dimension, the blackboard behind
the pianist and the old bells like interrogation-marks above his head
quite as important as the moving figures. And I had smiled and smiled.
After all, one might as well smile as not. Once you had got the smile
into its place it was just as easy. Really it would have been the
taking of it off again that would have required the mental effort.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>It was as I had stood there that Miss Causton had come up to me and
asked me if I did not dance. Her voice, as she had done so, had hardly
detached itself in my mind from the noise about us, and even her
figure, lending as it were its own life to her dress of oyster-grey,
had seemed no less flat and diagrammatic than the rest of the scene.
"No," I had said, and "No," she had repeated, with a nod, "getting the
piano up and down would be more your style, for it nearly killed those
boys this afternoon.... But won't you let me teach you?"</p>

<p>"I've no gloves."</p>

<p>"Gloves!" she had said softly.</p>

<p>And so, since besides smiling one may as well dance as not, I had
taken a dancing lesson from Miss Causton. But we had only gone twice
round the room&mdash;for which, considering my weight, I could hardly have
blamed her, and then, panting a little, she had proposed a rest. And
in the very bay from which I had once overheard her conversation with
Miss Windus I had talked civilities to her, still smiling. I had asked
whether she was coming back after Christmas and had been told "Yes,"
and when, by-and-by, as being less trouble than thinking of a new one,
I had put the same question to Miss Levey, I had got a "Yes" from her
also. After that I had worked that question really hard, putting it at
least once more to Miss Levey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> and once to somebody who was not at
the college at all, after which I had found a new one, I forget what,
making two quite useful social accomplishments. Once again Miss
Causton had come up to me. "&mdash;&mdash;since you don't come to me," I
remember her saying; "I should like some coffee." But she had barely
tasted the coffee I fetched her&mdash;I remember wondering whether I ought
to take her to the coffee or fetch the coffee to her&mdash;and then, just
in the middle of my third brilliant conversational find, she had
suddenly got up and left me.</p>

<p>And so on. The last had been similarly phantasmagoric. I had smiled
when Evie had come up and said reproachfully: "You can dance with
Louie!" and again when she had said: "I should like something to
drink&mdash;no, you mustn't fetch it&mdash;when you're asked for those things in
the middle of a dance it means that somebody wants to sit out with
you&mdash;but, oh dear! I forgotten that this was Archie's, and here he
is!..." It hadn't hurt much but I had had enough. The last person I
distinctly remember speaking to was Miss Levey, who had said that I
really must bring "somebody" to the next social. They had still been
dancing when I left.</p>

<p>Now that the disaster of my failure had befallen me, a year must
elapse before I could make a second attempt; and so it became quite
unnecessary that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> should return to the college after the Christmas
vacation of a month. The faraway autumn would be early enough for
that. The fees, small as they were, came fearfully heavy on me, and I
could study in the Patent Office Library for nothing.</p>

<p>But I wished to return in January. My many reasons for this are clear
to you. To the more obvious of them I will only add, that I seemed now
to be doomed to remain at Rixon Tebb &amp; Masters' for another year, and,
now that that strange and rather frightening calm of that night of the
breaking-up party had passed, I simply could not face the time ahead
without the alleviation, or at least the change of pain, that the
prospect of seeing Evie afforded.</p>

<p>So I decided to continue my course.</p>

<p>The days until the college should reopen on the 21st of February
were&mdash;I almost said purgatory to me, but in truth they purged me
little. It was the rainiest and muddiest of Christmas weeks; nobody
was out of doors who had a fire to sit by and leisure to sit by it,
and the streets were a bobbing of umbrellas and a squirting of mud
about the turned-up trousers of men and the skirts of women lifted to
their wearers cared not where. I tried to make the use of dubbin take
the place of the resoling of my boots, and in my chamber, which was
warmed only by my oil-stove, my garments never dried. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> a short
week at Rixon Tebb &amp; Masters', we were paid short too, and I shall
never forget my Christmas dinner of that year. For a fit of
desperation and impotent rebellion took me. I went for a change to
another "pull-up" than my usual one, and there paid tenpence for a
wholly insufficient dinner. I rebelled, I say. I brought my fist down
on the table, and out of sheer recklessness ordered the whole lot over
again. This proved too much for me. I couldn't eat half of it, but I
didn't care. How I was going to recoup myself for the double cost
afterwards I didn't know. If I had to have more money, I knew I should
have to get it somehow, that was all.</p>

<p>That was a villainous Christmas for me!</p>

<p>And I was alone&mdash;Archie at Guildford, Evie and her aunt I didn't know
where, perhaps at Guildford too, everybody with homes to go to and
faces to talk to over a fire. Archie's absence, too, cost me several
sixpences&mdash;the price of the hot baths I could not very well ask for at
his quarters while he was away. I spent my evenings in the Patent
Office Library, where it was warm.</p>

<p>I was glad when Christmas was over. I felt somehow that I was not
missing quite so much.</p>

<p>Then those who had been away for a holiday came back; the second and
third weeks of January passed; and on the twenty-first, a Monday, I
went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> the college again, as piteously joyful as if I had been an
outcast returning to open and welcoming arms again.</p>

<p>There were changes at the college. New students had come, several of
the old ones had left, among them Mackie, whose course was finished,
and we had a new "professor," who, it was said, was to start an
advertisement-writing class. But the biggest gap seemed to be left by
Miss Levey and Miss Causton, neither of whom, in spite of their
answers to my question at the breaking-up party, had returned. Miss
Levey, indeed was not returning; she had got a job; and I do not
conceal that this was a small relief to me. It put an end to the hints
and guessings and pertinacities that might still further have
embarrassed my not very clearly explained situation. But Miss Causton,
I gathered, had merely not come back yet. As it turned out later, she
did not come back. But nobody knew yet. So, until she should do so,
Evie and Miss Windus remained our only two woman students.</p>

<p>It is plain that I had had to think out a plausible reason for my own
return. I neither wished, nor would it have been credible of me, to be
regarded as one of those high-and-dry relics (every college and school
has them) who wear on to middle age seeing whole generations of
juniors out, and become pathetic "institutions" merely because they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
had not initiative to stop doing what they have once begun. So I had
hit on an explanation of my reappearance that, as it subsequently
turned out, cut two ways. In one of these ways it proved magnificently
sufficient for me; in the other it proved inadequate with an
inadequacy that I only partly rectified when I became engaged to Miss
Windus. In a word, I had had an idea.</p>

<p>My idea was this:</p>

<p>Starting from the old "Method" course (which, despite my failure, I
knew back and forth and inside out), I had begun to evolve for myself
a whole new course of private study. Much of this, I anticipated, I
should be able to pursue at the college; for the rest the British
Museum and the Patent Office Library would serve. The germ of my
notion lay (or at least began) in certain questions that bore on the
consolidation of Commercial Distribution; and I fancied, rightly as it
turned out, that my idea was in harmony with the broader developments
of the day. More than that I need not say. All that concerns this
story is that my new inspiration landed me straightway in a dilemma.
On the one hand, the newness of the idea proved to be the foundation
of my fortune, on the other, because of its very newness, and because
it surpassed the terms of the then known, it appeared to those who
wanted to know "what Jeffries was about," a subterfuge and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> a blind
for something else. In a small sense, as you are aware, it was that;
in a larger one it emphatically was not.</p>

<p>It is odd what difference a New Year makes in such colleges as ours.
The influx of new students always drives the older ones more closely
together, so that a person with whom the previous term you had little
more than a nodding acquaintance becomes, when you meet again, almost
an old friend. You have memories and associations in common that the
new-comers know nothing about, and quasi-amicable rearrangements are
made. I may say at once that it was not this that finally drove me
into Miss Windus's arms, but it helped in the early stages by breaking
down other resistances, and so made our extraordinary subsequent
relation possible.</p>

<p>Evie had told me, on the night when I had first walked home with her
to Woburn Place, that she usually went home either alone or else with
Miss Windus, who lived in Percy Street, Tottenham Court Road; and
while I, of course, had gone no farther than the gate, Miss Windus, I
knew, had on more than one occasion gone in to supper. In the new
order of things (which included Archie's "home from home") the three
of them not infrequently went to Woburn Place together, and I began to
see his light near the Foundling Hospital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> more and more rarely as I
passed. Of course it didn't at all follow that because he was not in
his own quarters he was at Woburn Place; I knew for a fact that very
often he was not; and I learned from Mackie, whom I ran into one
evening as I was returning from Rixon Tebb &amp; Masters', and to whom I
forced myself to talk, that on at least one recent occasion Master
Archie had been seen flying a none-too-steadily-balanced kite in the
neighbourhood of Leicester Square. The "home from home" was a capital
one from the point of view of Mrs. Merridew, no doubt; but from that
of Miss Soames the aunt, into whose house, whether she knew it or not,
some whiff at least of another atmosphere was being brought, the thing
seemed very open indeed to question.</p>

<p>Evie, I could see now, was lost in love of him; and I sometimes
wondered whether I was not becoming hopelessly one-idea-ridden to
suppose that it could all possibly end in any but the plain and
obvious way&mdash;by her marriage to him. Changes that I shall speak of
presently were taking place quickly in myself, and perhaps it was the
first sign of them that sometimes, when I found myself utterly spent
and broken, melodramatic magnanimities rose in my brain. In these
moments I was tempted to throw up the struggle, to take myself off
somewhere, and to leave them to arrange matters as they would.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> I
wonder&mdash;I wonder!&mdash;whether I should have had the strength to do it!</p>

<p>And I wonder too whether, had I done it, it would have been "strength"
at all! I hardly think it would. I will not generalise about slack
young men and blind and innocent girls; I am not concerned with
collective morals; but I was concerned with the given case, and
already saw how things would almost inevitably turn out. Archie, after
the manner of his kind, would sandwich in his visits to Woburn Place
with more suspect pleasures; presently there would come some accident
of detection, or there would not; if there did he would make a more or
less (probably less) clean breast of it, and if there did not it would
become a question of how far he would go with Evie. At that also I
could make a guess. A "home from home," is not quite what it seems
when the home contains a young creature who follows the befriended
young man about with soft and adoring eyes; parents and aunts notice
these things; one day something would happen; and Archie, who never
took any other line, would take the line of least resistance and,
seeing that it was expected of him, become formally engaged to her.</p>

<p>And then what? Ah, I foresaw that too!</p>

<p>She would be, as the expression goes, "no worse" for him. For that
also he lacked the courage. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> would sloven himself and her into a
love that would soon prove irksome to him, a bitterness to her, and
pure only on a technicality. I knew his breed; To the best of them
Woburn Place is Woburn Place, and Leicester Square Leicester Square;
and to the worst of them these two things quickly interpenetrate and
weld. And what would that mean for her? I looked at my love; I looked
about me at other sad and disillusioned women who have survived their
fair dreams as examples of the way in which this love-slovening
actually works out; and I shuddered.</p>

<p>No, a magnanimous removal of myself would not have been "strength" at
all.</p>

<p>Yet if you think I became engaged to Miss Windus merely that I might
have a pair of eyes frequently in Woburn Place, there you are wrong
again. I became engaged to her because I had no choice. The
contributory causes were several. Among the earlier of them had been a
conversation I had had with Archie Merridew a week before the
examination in Method.</p>

<p>After I had been at pains to give out the information that I was
engaged as it were at large and without further particularity, I had
begun, as you have already guessed, to be the victim of my own
ingenuity. Our committances have this way of taking matters into their
own hands. I had quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> found it impossible to be thus
unspecifically betrothed. Too many questions had instantly sprung up,
and Archie, if not Miss Levey, had known too much about the
circumstances of my life.</p>

<p>At first I had tried to fob him off by speaking of "some girl in the
City," but that had been useless. If that was so, he had wanted to
know (probably having gossipped it all over with Miss Levey), why did
I never see her in the evenings, and why was I so often at liberty on
Saturday afternoons and Sundays? I had protested, I had made jokes.
How, I had demanded, did <i>he</i> know where I passed my spare time?...
Well, he knew (he had retorted) where I spent five evenings out of the
seven!</p>

<p>Miss Levey, you see, had started him, and it amused him to go on.</p>

<p>And so his intrusiveness had begun to narrow me down to the college
itself.</p>

<p>This had given me the choice of just two <i>inamorata</i>&mdash;Miss Causton and
Miss Windus (for I still supposed that Miss Causton might walk into
the college as usual any evening). To the latter lady I was at that
time exceedingly averse; and on the night of this conversation of
which I speak, after Archie had been almost beyond endurance jestingly
importunate, I had all but declared myself point blank for the absent
Miss Causton. (The conversation had taken place in his rooms.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>"The question is, Archie," I said gravely, looking at him with sharp
doubt in my eyes, "can I trust you? I suspect you've already set
something going, you know."</p>

<p>He had coloured a little. A mere honourable understanding was never in
the least binding on him, and I was never quite sure to what extent
the exaction of a definite promise would be so.</p>

<p>"Oh, dash it all, Jeff!" he had scoffed rather awkwardly,
"anybody'd think you were ashamed of it! All I said was quite
harmless&mdash;really&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," I had commented, "<i>meaning</i> no harm. Nine-tenths of the harm
in the world's done that way. I don't know that I don't prefer the man
who means harm; at least he knows what he's doing.... But why are you
so curious about it all?"</p>

<p>His curiosity, I knew, was nothing more or less than a slack
indulgence of his desire to hear a secret. He had too Miss Levey's
racial gift of turning these things to account. But he had put it
rather differently.</p>

<p>"Oh, just friendly interest," he had replied, slapping his jacket
pocket. "Where did I put my cigarette case?... We <i>are</i> friends,
aren't we?"</p>

<p>"Rather less so when you go chattering about me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sorry, old man," he had replied contritely, though his contrition had
been less for his blabbing than that I apparently had taken it amiss.
"I didn't think&mdash;you didn't tell me not&mdash;it slipped out&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well&mdash;no great harm's done. But if I were you&mdash;" if I had
hesitated it was merely for a private and subtle relish "&mdash;I'd take a
memory powder, to use an expression of Miss Windus's."</p>

<p>(You will remember how I had come to overhear that expression, and you
may see, by turning back, the precise context of the allusion.)</p>

<p>Archie had been sitting in his favourite attitude, with his stockinged
feet against the pilaster of the fireplace. He had twinkled again.</p>

<p>"I don't think it <i>can</i> be Miss Windus," he had chuckled again.
"Anybody can see you can't stand her."</p>

<p>"Oh? Sorry I've allowed that to appear."</p>

<p>"And the college isn't exactly swarming with girls," he had continued.</p>

<p>I had told him that he was dragging the college in entirely on his own
responsibility.</p>

<p>"Oh no!" he had said promptly, with a far too cunning glance at me.
"You don't put me off like that, old boy! I've got you down to that,
and I'm going to hold you to it! Serve you right for your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> dashed
secretiveness! So if it isn't Miss Windus, and it isn't Miss
Soames&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that I had been able quite calmly to jest. I had fetched up a
laugh.</p>

<p>"Steady a minute," I had said. "If you're really bent on going into
the Sherlock Holmes business you'll have to do it properly, you
know&mdash;give reasons for your eliminations. Accuracy's everything. Let's
have your reason for ruling Miss Soames out."</p>

<p>"Good old Jeff," he had remarked, laughing; "accurate even in his
jokes! Well, say Evie's a young twenty, and you're a damned
experienced old thirty&mdash;how will <i>that</i> do?"</p>

<p>I believe, taken with all the rest, that it had seemed to him
perfectly conclusive.</p>

<p>"That's better," I had approved. "I only meant that if you're going to
be methodical you must <i>be</i> methodical, that's all. Good mental
training for you, my boy."</p>

<p>"So it is," he had agreed, with the forthcoming examination in his
mind. "I say&mdash;we'll have a shorthand speed-test presently&mdash;but first
I'm going to drag this out of you...."</p>

<p>And by-and-by I had all but made the confession that it was Miss
Causton whom I adored from a distance and hesitated to approach.</p>

<p>Another contributory source to this oddest freak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> of my life was the
terms on which I had returned to the college. That wide and unexpected
development of my new studies was no explanation to anybody but
myself; I had confessed myself, through Archie, to be in love; and the
more closely I applied myself to my mysterious work the less
mysterious did my whole conduct appear. Yet on the whole, even if Miss
Causton had returned at once, I might at the last have feared the
hazard with one at once so suspiciously open and problematically deep
as she; and there was no allowing matters to remain as they were.
There was only Miss Windus for it.</p>

<p>You see the mess I had landed myself in.</p>

<p>Yet my unhappiness in all this was only a part of a general change
that was quickly leavening me throughout. It was a change altogether
for the better. I was sick, sick of shifts and tricks and meannesses.
I was no less sick of them in myself than I was when I encountered
them in the Sutts and Polwheles among whom my life was passed. I
panted for a clearer air and a more spacious prospect; I panted for
these things because Evie had loosened the band that had confined the
wings of my own spirit. And with my own spirit thus freed, I would
find a way to escape from the cage of my circumstances. Once I had
done with that old life I would have done with it for ever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> And,
strange as it may seem, it was because hope was at last greyly and
tardily dawning for me that I entered into my last despicable
tortuousness with Kitty Windus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p><br></p>
<h3>II</h3>

<p>For as I got deeper into my studies I began to see in it nothing less
than the finger of Providence that I had failed in the second part of
the examination in Method. That frustration altered the whole course
of my life. I am, of course, speaking in the light of subsequent
events, but I see now what a mere pass would have meant&mdash;a sort of
success no doubt&mdash;but a success in a narrow and short-reaching
attempt.</p>

<p>Up to that time my plan had been to qualify myself by means of
certificates, to find a billet elsewhere, and then, with Rixon Tebb &amp;
Masters' recommendation of steadiness and sobriety, really to begin in
some firm where promotion was possible otherwise than by our
bottle-neck of a junior clerkship. I had actually had the choice of
no less than two such firms, and had been already wondering what I
should do with my extra twelve shillings a week&mdash;for I should have
begun at thirty shillings.</p>

<p>And then I had failed.</p>

<p>Well, heaven be thanked for it. In that failure I sounded, for the
last time&mdash;but no; for the last time but one&mdash;the bass-string of my
poverty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>For now, as I saw my new work gradually unfolding, it sometimes so
excited me that I could hear my own heart thumping in my breast. Do
you know that feeling&mdash;that in your brain there is already born, and
growing apace, an idea that you do not believe to be guessed at by any
creature in the world except yourself? As a matter of fact I now know
that my idea was being simultaneously worked upon elsewhere. Sir
Julius (then "Judy") Pepper was pegging away at it in his back room in
Endsleigh Gardens, hardly a mile from where I brooded over it myself;
and if you have never heard of the association of Jeffries and Pepper
you know very little about these things. Still, all was in darkness
then save for that single ray far ahead that seemed to indicate a way
out; and even now I have only just begun my life's work&mdash;the keying up
to concert pitch of certain branches of commercial distribution that,
by the time I and my successors have finished, will make men wonder
how such a phenomenon as, say, the railway strike of last year could
ever have been possible.</p>

<p>Nor was this deepest peace that the man of action knows&mdash;his certainty
about what his task in the world must be&mdash;the whole of my spirit's
unexpected re-birth. This held out the promise of material&mdash;and shall
I say "ethical?"&mdash;well-being; and my eyes were now opened to more than
that. I hesitate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> to call this new thing "religion." I would rather
define it as the clear and immutable knowledge that all things <i>do</i>
work together to an end, good, bad or morally unconnoted. It was a
perception of powers and forces, not at variance, but working in
harmony towards some cosmic consummation. I don't think that is
religion. I don't think it would save a soul. But it not only saved,
but made altogether its own, my reason. I believed in the power and
divinity of a thing, if not in those of a Being. And I believe that I
should have got further even than that.</p>

<p>And if it be true that we treat the world as we are treated by it,
this changed my attitude to all with whom I came into contact. I am
not thinking now of Kitty Windus, for she, poor soul, was but an
episode, though one I have found is hard enough to make away with. I
am thinking of Sutt, of Polwhele, of the proprietor of my
public-house, of the drivers and porters of my restaurant, of the men
and women, seen and to be seen no more, who passed me in the streets.
And I am thinking of Evie Soames.</p>

<p>For it was side by side with her sweetness that I conceived all this
authority and strength and vision to exist. It was all, I knew not
how, hers&mdash;hers and mine. I could not successfully resolve a problem
nor work out an equation but something within me cried, "That is ours,
my love!&mdash;something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> seized from the limbo of things-not-known-yet,
for you, dear, and for me!" I could now even bear to work away from
her, in another room of the college, among the files of the Patent
Office, at my own place. When her face rose, as it ever did, between
me and my paper or page, I knew peace now, not jealousy. Had I put
into words the thoughts that then filled me those words would have
been, "Yes, my own&mdash;you see what I'm doing&mdash;it is for us, and it won't
be long&mdash;go away, sweetheart, but not very far." And so I dreamed
harder and worked harder than I have ever done in my life, and both
came easily to me, because I had at last clearly seen my goal.</p>

<p>Yet you are not to suppose that I was not unwinkingly wakeful too.
This was my inner life, and it informed, but did not abate, the
vigilance of my outer one. I think that three times out of four I knew
(at first at any rate) when Archie had been to Woburn Place, and
perhaps twice out of four when he had sought a lower pleasure
elsewhere. It would take too long to tell you how I ascertained all
this. I did so under a mask of casualness that practice and my
new-born hope had now made quite easy.</p>

<p>And so I come to my acceptance by Kitty Windus.</p>

<p>Espionage upon Woburn Place was only a part, and by far the lesser
part, of it. I had my impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> position to explain. And not only
had I to explain it, but my original lie had left me only one other
way of explaining it&mdash;the giving up of Evie once for all. That I could
have more easily done months back than I could now that hope had
brought her so (I speak comparatively) tantalisingly near. I admit
that the chance that I might be introduced at Woburn Place as Miss
Windus's <i>fiancée</i> did weigh, and horribly. I no longer hated her. I
pitied her. I do not mean that this pity was in the least degree akin
to love in that word's sense as between man and woman; but by salving
a little my self-content it did, practically, help me to carry the
thing out. But I swear, however much I may appear to put myself upon
the defensive in doing so, that of itself the prospect of Woburn Place
would not have swayed me.</p>

<p>I have not the heart to remember the earlier stages of my duplicity.
Too many crawling things lie beneath that stone of my life for me to
wish to turn it over. Let me summarise by saying that, by a slow and
nicely calculated relaxing of my stiffness, and a gradual and
lingering and gratuitous prolongation ever and again of certain
opportunities of intercourse, I had, by the beginning of March, so
counterbalanced my former aversion that, in a word, anything might
happen, and at any moment.</p>

<p>Poor, lonely, starved spinster heart! I have far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> more ruth for what I
did to you than for what I did to another!</p>

<p>But let me, before I go on, see whether there was anything during the
months of January and February that I may not omit.... No, I think
there is little. Miss Causton still remained away; I pursued my new
investigations; that segregation of newness of the first-year students
relaxed a little, but without affecting that slight unconscious coming
together of the older ones that it had brought about; and I think
Archie Merridew divided his time between Woburn Place and Leicester
Square pretty equally. I think that is all. I pass on.</p>

<p>It was in Lincoln's Inn Fields that I entered into a pledge with Kitty
Windus that I had no intention of ever redeeming. I had not thought
when I had left the college that night that it would come so quickly.
I had planned a long walk, and, passing through Great Turnstile, had
come upon Miss Windus looking into the window of an antique shop. I
had stopped and gazed with her, and then, presently moving away, we
had passed together into the square.</p>

<p>She told me afterwards that she had been merely aimlessly wandering,
having been to Woburn Place the evening before and fearing to weary
her welcome there by going again the next night; but I did not know
this then. Therefore, when presently she stopped at the corner where
the street leading to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> Kingsway now is and said, "Well, I think I'll
go back," I was a little surprised. Then I understood and laughed.</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry," I said, "I thought this was your way. I don't know
that it's particularly mine&mdash;I was only taking a stroll&mdash;so if you
don't mind I'll walk back with you."</p>

<p>Thereupon we turned back into the Fields.</p>

<p>It was this mutually made discovery that neither of us was pressed for
time that brought simultaneously into our minds some slight
self-consciousness that for the first time in our lives we should be
thus killing an hour in one another's company. Her own embarrassment
presently gave expression to this.</p>

<p>"How nice," she said, after we had walked half the length of the
central garden railings in silence, "to feel sometimes that you
haven't got to talk if you don't want to!"</p>

<p>The remark, commonplace as it was, gave me a new glimpse of her. I
knew that she read a better class of novel than my Evie, and with the
results you might suppose. I don't seriously believe that Evie's
"scions of noble blood" and the rest of her novelette paraphernalia
had any point of contact with real life for her, but Miss Windus
carried over the triteness she got from her reading into her thought
and speech. Therefore, since I myself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> though no eloquent speaker,
believe that tongues were made to talk with, I again laughed a little.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, "provided always that you aren't silent merely
because you've nothing to say."</p>

<p>I think this penetration, such as it was, struck her with quite
remarkable force; and, as the novels provided no reply to it, she was
again silent for a time. We were approaching the corner of Great
Turnstile again, but I don't think she noticed it. We turned down by
Stone Buildings and began to complete the circuit of the Fields.</p>

<p>"Mr Merridew said you were very clever," she remarked at last. "What
<i>do</i> you study all by yourself in the senior classroom, Mr Jeffries?"
she asked, the quizzical little triangles of her eyes turned up to
mine in the light of a lamp that hung like a beacon over the garden
railings. She wore a plaid Inverness cape and a boat-shaped hat that
night, I remember, and would doubtless have worn rubber heels had
those articles been invented. Never woman made a slighter physical
appeal to man than she.</p>

<p>"I'm not quite sure myself yet," I replied, as truthfully as made no
matter. "Part of it at any rate is human nature in business."</p>

<p>"I love human nature," she said.</p>

<p>I knew I had only to speak. In the light of the wrong I was about to
do her I freely forgave her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> all her past pretences towards myself.
All grapes had been sour to poor Kitty, and I didn't doubt she had
made brave attempts, and still braver concealments of failure. Baboon
or anybody else, there she was at his pleasure so her reproach be but
taken away. For already I had decided that it might as well be now as
later.</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered, as if absently, and we walked on.</p>

<p>The night was slightly frosty, and over the houses to the north of the
Fields the glare of Holborn shone rustily. There were few people
about. As we walked, by this time almost used to the strangeness of
one another's company, I wished that the central garden of the square
had not been closed; at least she would have had the association of a
tree and a plot of grass to go with her plighting. But I knew that
such weaknesses as this were not safe, and shut peremptorily down on
them. She seemed so pathetically small and skimpy by my side, and had
I yielded even a little I could almost have persuaded myself of a
tenderness for her. This I refused to do. I would do nothing to make
easy for myself what would by-and-by prove cruel enough for her.</p>

<p>We were half way round the Fields on our second circuit before I spoke
again. I moistened my lips and steeled myself.</p>

<p>"Miss Windus," I said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>I think a tremor took her instantly with my change of tone. She looked
up, but I did not hear whether she said anything.</p>

<p>Nor did I say anything. Our hands, as we walked, were close together.
I took hers.</p>

<p>She made no attempt to draw it away, and we walked so. Presently I
took the hand in my other one, and this brought it across my breast. I
daresay she felt the beating of my heart.</p>

<p>"Kitty," I whispered.</p>

<p>She pressed against me a little.</p>

<p>I don't think it ever entered her head that I intended anything but
just that we should walk, for that one night, round Lincoln's Inn
Fields like this. I don't believe she thought of anything. With even
that heel and paring of love she was content&mdash;just to walk so,
to-morrow if it was to be, if not then at any rate to-night, with her
hand in a man's and her shoulder pressing lightly against a man's
shoulder.</p>

<p>Well, she had it.</p>

<p>"Kitty," I whispered again. This was in a dark shadow on the south
side of the Fields. Without prearrangement we had ceased to walk, and
were standing together, she with her face turned downwards and away,
quite ready to give me all she supposed I wanted of her.</p>

<p>She couldn't murmur my name in return. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> didn't know it. It was,
for her, merely "Man." But instead she gave me that for which I
stooped over her. She gave it with a heartrending impulsiveness
throwing back her head suddenly and leaning her bosom on mine. I felt
a pair of dry, slightly cracked lips on my own and was conscious of an
odour of clothes.... Then we separated again.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, with a shaky little exhalation of her breath, "I ... I
didn't think you'd ever look at me&mdash;Jeff!"</p>

<p>This last was a quick invention, to cover her ignorance of my
Christian name.</p>

<p>She meant that she hadn't thought that anybody would ever look at her.
Every shred of the old pretence of the pertinacities and annoyances of
strangers had fallen from her. She lifted up her face again&mdash;and
again&mdash;as if by present gluttony to forestall insatiable hungers of
the morrow and the morrow after that.</p>

<p>For a minute I was well-nigh resolved out of sheer compassion to keep
my word and marry her.</p>

<p>And even then&mdash;think of it!&mdash;she had no idea that I contemplated what
was, indeed, my sole reason for action&mdash;an acknowledged engagement.
She never dreamed I meant to marry her. It was I who spoke of this,
half-an-hour later. By that time we had been to the bottom of Chancery
Lane and back, and were in the Fields again, once more in that same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
shadow where I had kissed her first. She looked at me.</p>

<p>I can hardly write it. There was first a gleam of fear in her eyes,
and then a leaping.</p>

<p>"<i>Jeff!</i>" she cried in a loud voice that cracked.</p>

<p>I had to catch her as she began slowly to sink at the knees.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" >

<p>So I became engaged. At the college it was a nine days' wonder, but I
let them wonder. So did Kitty Windus, merely pretending that the thing
had been for long a secret understanding. Archie, I remember, smirked
through some form of congratulation when I told him: "What, <i>not</i>
Louie after all!" but it was only when Evie Soames flung her arms
about Kitty Windus' neck and well-nigh about mine also that I began
really to wonder what could possibly come of it all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p><br></p>
<h3>III</h3>

<p>During those little pauses and lapses of study in which men scribble
abstractedly on the margins of paper, idly forming letters or
noughts-and-crosses or inexpert attempts at portraiture, I myself had
a way of filling my blanks at that time that may serve to explain the
change that had more and more come over me. I used to rub with a
pencil, as evenly as possible, two little squares of grey, and then to
put into the middle of the first of them a spot as black as my pencil
could make it, leaving in the second a similar spot, but one of clean
white. Unless you have tried it you may not believe the difference in
effect. The black spot of the first seems to make denser and darker
the whole square; but the white one lightens and relieves it as the
sun does when it struggles through a mist. By what law of optics this
is to be explained I cannot tell; I can only say that if Kitty Windus,
wondering what I studied all by myself in the senior classroom, had
come upon me at these times, she would have found me pondering over
these marginal trifles as in some way a symbol of my own life.</p>

<p>For had it not been for this gloomy blot of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> betrothal to her I
would not now have exchanged my life for that of any man I knew. So
did hope now irradiate it. I was still an eighteen-shilling Agency
clerk; I still lived in a red and green loft over a public-house; but
I now believed in myself, longed to be able to respect myself, and had
already grimly resolved that others should respect me.</p>

<p>I was in this state of mind when I first set eyes on Angela Soames.</p>

<p>I was taken there, of course&mdash;to Woburn Place, I mean&mdash;by Kitty
Windus. It was within a week of our engagement, so that I had not to
wait long for these first-fruits of my extraordinary position. That
night was the second time I walked with Evie to her abode, for Archie
followed a few yards behind with Kitty Windus. We had dropped into
this arrangement on leaving the college, as men tacitly pay each
other's partners the courtesy of their attentions.</p>

<p>When I have said that Evie's home was in Woburn Place I have gone a
long way towards describing it. She lived in one of those large
apartment houses that are full of Japanese, Americans, and Indian law
students, with a half-pay officer here and there. She and her aunt had
rooms of their own upstairs, but they dined in the large common
dining-room downstairs, at a table that would almost have resembled
that of a public dinner had it not been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> for the gaps left by the
absent boarders, several of whom were always dining elsewhere. I never
saw that table full. I have tried to carry on a conversation with my
neighbour across two intervening empty chairs. I have had to accept
the highly polished civilities of Indians and Japanese, who have
refused to disturb me when I have removed a rolled napkin in a
numbered ring and put a flat and freshly ironed one in its place. One
met niggers and gouty subjects and antiquated old ladies in the hall
and on the stairs; and I was quite prepared to find Miss Soames the
aunt one of these last.</p>

<p>But she was not in the least so. There was not very much more
difference between her age and my own than there was between mine and
Evie's&mdash;though of course what difference there was was all on the
wrong side. She was, I should say, forty-three or four, and I wondered
the moment I saw her how she had got through these forty odd years and
remained Miss Angela. Let me say at once that she had no secret sorrow
(though Kitty always vowed she had). When, later, she told me, with
the greatest self-pluming in the world, that she "could have been
married" more than once or twice, she told me nothing I should not
have guessed; but merely to have had these opportunities seemed
entirely to content her detached and unruffled and rather aimless
soul. She had had the refusal of them&mdash;and she coquetted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> with that.
She had avoided the pains of marriage&mdash;and remained the white-haired
<i>ingenué</i>. It later became one of Kitty's irritating tricks to "wish
she had hair like that"&mdash;a beautiful tower of it dressed <i>à la
Marquise</i>; but in nothing else could Kitty ever have resembled Angela
Soames.... But perhaps I may be wrong in my estimate after all.
Perhaps no man can really understand that kind of woman, who cannot
lose all herself even when she marries and loses not very much less
when she does not. Evie, I concluded, probably had her passion for
abandonment from her mother.</p>

<p>I was introduced to the elder Miss Soames in her sitting-room. This
apartment, like herself, seemed to trail even into Woburn Place hems
and fringes of past prosperity. The room itself was not much more than
a cold-blue-papered, corniceless box&mdash;but, as the first of a number of
odd little contrasts, a shield-shaped embroidered firescreen hung on a
slender stem near the fire. The door was painted yellow and
grained&mdash;but a pair of handsome silver candlesticks stood on the
mantelpiece. There was a threadbare lodging-house carpet&mdash;and a black
bear-skin hearthrug, the head of the animal worn bald by Miss Angela's
paste-buckled slipper. And so on. On the round table stood a
rosy-shaded lamp (that did <i>not</i> change to a corresponding shade of
green as you looked). Miss Angela herself wore a soft old grey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> with a
thin Indian silk shawl cast over her shoulders, and I remembered, as I
looked at her, certain former angry conclusions I had come to about
her. I took them all back. Charmingly unsure of herself in everything,
from her love affairs downwards, she might be, but she did not parrot
precepts about the "less fortunately circumstanced." We shook hands,
and I was told that I might smoke. Archie had come in smoking.</p>

<p>I did not talk very much during this my first call. Indeed, Miss
Angela murmured, as if to herself, some half-mischievous, half-tactful
remark about an "ordeal"; and my slight nervousness passed as part of
Kitty's "showing off" of me. But the others made up for me, and I
listened, smiling, but silent except when I was directly addressed.</p>

<p>This I presently was by Miss Angela, and on a point no less
interesting than the way in which Archie spent his evenings. It had
already appeared that he was to celebrate a birthday two days thence,
and Miss Angela had asked him to spend the evening with them.</p>

<p>"You've given us a very cold shoulder lately," she said; "why, your
mother's been remarking on it!" She pulled a faded tapestry hassock
towards her with her foot, the fire being too hot to allow her to make
use of the bear's head, and reached for a paper fan with which to keep
the heat from her face. "I hope it's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> not <i>you</i> who take up all his
time, Mr Jeffries?"</p>

<p>I answered that it was not, and Evie, who had removed her hat and coat
and was now tidying her hair before the mantelpiece mirror, laughed.</p>

<p>"Mr Jeffries' time is spoken for now&mdash;isn't it, Kitty?" she said.</p>

<p>I saw her look at Archie as she said it. He was astride the hearthrug,
allowing the smoke of his cigarette to stream up his nostrils, and
she, as she arranged her hair, had to look at herself almost over his
shoulder. Her occupation left the whole of her young bosom quite
defenceless had there been a pair of arms to pass about it, and the
soft look she gave him was a double provocation. But he did not return
the look. He moved a little aside, also finding the fire hot, and
flipped his cigarette ash into the fender.</p>

<p>"I don't think an engaged girl ought to come between a man and all his
old friends," Kitty pronounced. Her look at me was a promise that she
would never come between me and Archie.</p>

<p>Miss Angela gave a contented little laugh.</p>

<p>"Ah, you all say that at first! Well...." She glanced past Evie at me,
and took me into her confidence with a private smile. It was as if we
two older ones understood that there was something in process that
must not be disturbed. "But if you don't come, Archie," she added, "I
shall write<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> straight to your mother! You'll come too, Miss Windus?"</p>

<p>Kitty glanced at me.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course I mean Mr Jeffries too!" said Miss Angela archly.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course him too!" quoth Archie, from the hearthrug, loosening
his scorching trousers. "Two hearts that beat as one&mdash;you
bet&mdash;twopence into a penny show <i>now</i>, Jeff!"</p>

<p>And again Miss Angela, with a look this time past him, seemed to
invite my attention to something.</p>

<p>You may guess that my attention needed little inviting. So far, my
surmise, that she adored him while she took the admiration a little
impatiently, seemed to be pretty near the mark; and I was confirmed in
this when she presently sat down on the companion hassock beyond the
end of the fender, and, with her face a little averted, sank into
moroseness. It was merely because her glance as she stood before the
mirror had not been returned, but I myself had known too well what it
was to be uplifted and cast down again by these nothings not to
understand.</p>

<p>And Archie too understood, if the jocular and would-be easy manner in
which he tried to drag her into the conversation again meant anything.
I suspected that this was not the first incident of the kind that had
occurred between them. Presently he had twice addressed her directly
without getting more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> than the shortest of replies; and the third time
he did so (he, Kitty and Miss Angela had been talking about some
indifferent matter) he added the words, "that is, when Evie's found
her tongue again."</p>

<p>My darling had a temper of her own. "I didn't know I'd lost it," she
said, with a little perverse snap.</p>

<p>Then she dropped into her sulks again.</p>

<p>"These lovers' quarrels!" Miss Angela's private smile to me seemed to
say; but this time I evaded the discreet invitation to participate.</p>

<p>"Well," Archie said presently, looking at his watch, "I must be off;
I've a chap to meet. Thanks, Aunt Angela (beg pardon; I know you don't
like being called that). I'll come on Thursday, then."</p>

<p>But Miss Angela exclaimed: "A man to meet! At this hour!"</p>

<p>Archie took his hat from a chair. "Yes. About a dog. Why not? Fox
terrier," he added facetiously; "must make sure they've got over the
distemper, you know. Thursday then. You two are staying a bit, I
suppose?" he invited us.</p>

<p>He made his adieux; but almost before the door had closed behind him
Evie had risen from her hassock.</p>

<p>"You'll excuse me, won't you?" she said quickly. "I've got a headache.
I shall go straight to bed. Good-night."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>And she followed him out&mdash;whether straight to bed or not I don't know.
Kitty and I followed shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>And now that I've got to this Woburn Place portion of my story I may
as well, while I am about it, skip the two intervening days and come
to the evening of Archie Merridew's birthday.</p>

<p>Thursday was not in any case one of Evie's class evenings, and on that
Thursday she must have been very busy indeed. We were to go to supper
at eight; and as the routine of the boarding house did not provide for
private entertainments the aunt and niece had had all to do
themselves. The supper was therefore of necessity cold, with the
exception of some hot soup, which I suspect to have been heated over a
bedroom fire; and for the furnishing of the round table with the
pink-shaded lamp Miss Angela had rummaged in drawers and trunks and
bundles, with notable results. White heavy plates with the name of the
boarding house contained within an oval garter were set between common
knives and delicate and worn old silver forks and spoons, really
beautiful glass finger-bowls stood on straw mats with a circular hole
in the middle; and a long slender-handled punch-ladle stuck up out of
the cheap earthenware jug full of home-made lemonade.</p>

<p>I suspect, too, that Evie had changed her mind a dozen times about the
height of her dress at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> neck; and probably her aunt's guidance had
led her finally, since she had no special dress for the evening, to
reject the compromise of altering her blouse to an intermediate <b>V</b>. Her
dark hair had been newly washed. A softer lace than Kitty Windus' came
quite up to her ears, and Miss Angela had lent her a pearl ring, which
seemed to be mutely asking to be transferred to the finger next to the
one on which she wore it. She was in white, with a longer skirt than
usual; Miss Angela wore the old grey and Indian silk shawl she always
wore; and Kitty looked prettier than I have ever seen her in a spotted
blue foulard (I think I have that right) with wonderfully crimped
sleeves and a cameo brooch at her rather wiry throat.</p>

<p>She and I arrived before Archie, who, indeed, was a full quarter of an
hour late. When he did turn up, there mingled with his apologies the
bumptious assumption of ease with which he sought to make a joke of
his negligence. He came in noisily, as if he intended to make the
party a success out of hand; and before he had been in the room
half-a-minute a whiff told me what I had instantly surmised from the
brightness of his eyes&mdash;that he had been drinking sherry and bitters
already.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Aunt Angela&mdash;but that's not all, I hope!" he cried, as Miss
Angela wished him many happy returns of the day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>And he skipped to her, passed his arm about her waist, and kissed her.</p>

<p>"Hope you won't mind for once, Jeff," he went on, dancing to Kitty
Windus. Kitty both stiffened rigidly and flushed with excitement as he
kissed her also on the cheek-bone.</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;I'm going all round now&mdash;where's Evie?" he demanded.</p>

<p>But Evie had slipped out of the room.</p>

<p>We sat down to supper.</p>

<p>I found Archie insufferable. He made the whole running with an
ignorant egotism that caused my fingers to itch to box his ears. More
than once he contradicted Miss Angela flatly, instantly trying to
redeem the grossness by laughing loudly and crying, "Excuse my
frankness&mdash;no offence&mdash;only Archie's way!" He made so familiar both
with Kitty and myself that, out of mere hostility to him, I came very
near to an alliance with her. Evie, I saw, was miserable. How much she
knew about his habits I could only guess; I think that already she
knew more than a little; but his had been the fortune to reveal her to
herself, and I am not sure whether that ever wholly dies. I think it
has since died as much as ever it can.</p>

<p>"But," Miss Angela said by-and-by, seeking to quieten him, "I've
forgotten to ask you how your father is. Better, I hope?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>"The pater? Oh, he's all right; it's only a bilious attack. Afraid he
got poisoned with some <i>foie gras</i> he ate&mdash;jolly good tack <i>I</i> call
it&mdash;I'll have some more, please. And what's that you've got to drink
there, Evie?"</p>

<p>Evie poured him out some lemonade. He looked at it, but made no remark
on it.</p>

<p>"Here's your <i>foie gras</i>&mdash;have some cress with it," said Miss Angela.</p>

<p>And so we fêted his lordship.</p>

<p>After supper there were nuts and almonds, which we ate sitting round
the fire. I say "we," but Archie had what was left afterwards. With a
"Half-a-mo," he had gone out, and I myself thought our party much
pleasanter without him.</p>

<p>But as he remained away, Miss Angela had no choice but to say
presently: "What <i>can</i> have become of our young man? I wonder if you'd
mind fetching him, Mr Jeffries!"</p>

<p>I went, and found him.</p>

<p>He had picked up, on the stairs or in the hall, a Japanese with whom
he had contracted some sort of acquaintance, and I heard his call as I
passed the half-open door of the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;Jeff!" he called. "Hold on&mdash;I sha'n't be a minute&mdash;come and let
me introduce you to Mr Shoto&mdash;Mr Shoto, Mr Jeffries."</p>

<p>I distrust that too affable little race from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> other side of the
world, and I gave Mr Shoto the most perfunctory of nods. Archie was
having a very golden whisky and soda with him.</p>

<p>"Come along&mdash;you oughtn't to clear off like this," I said curtly.
"Miss Soames is asking for you."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;good old Angela&mdash;just a minute till I finish this. We were
talking about Japan, or rather Mr Shoto was. Tell him that about the
Yoshiwara, Shoto."</p>

<p>But that cunning little alien had evidently summed me up already, and
had a different choice of subject for me.</p>

<p>I haled Archie back. I wondered, as he sat down by Evie, whether he
would have another man about another dog to see presently, but he
hadn't. Magnanimously he gave us the whole of the rest of the evening.
This he did in spite of the cold encouragement he got from Evie.
Twice, I was certain, while his face did not cease to be animated with
the talk he gave the rest of us, his hand sought hers behind the arm
of his chair; but she drew away. Nevertheless she drew away
discreetly. By doing so openly she could have shown him up, but
evidently she did not wish to show him up. There was no irreconcilable
difference between them. She was angry, but not to the point of
refusing to make it up afterwards. And I knew she was not far from
unhappy tears.</p>

<p>Kitty and I were the first to leave. This was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> half-past eleven,
and I had no desire to outsit Archie. He would either leave in another
half-hour, which would leave him time for another golden whisky and
soda, or, setting the smoothing over of Evie's ruffled temper before
the attractions of the public-house, would linger till after
closing-time, when there would be no hurry. To see which alternative
he would take didn't on the whole seem to be worth waiting for.</p>

<p>So Kitty and I took our leave; and as I walked with her to Percy
Street&mdash;where she had two rooms over a modiste's&mdash;I&mdash;and she too&mdash;had
to suffer as best we might the kind of thing I will relate in the next
chapter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p><br></p>
<h3>IV</h3>

<p>From the beginning she wanted one thing, I another. She was prepared
to "love" me (as if it had been a matter of will, to which,
nevertheless, I am quite certain she would faithfully have adhered) on
the condition that that heart of hers should be no longer a parched
pod; but I wanted no more of her than that my name should be linked
with hers as that of her suitor. To me the appearance was the
indispensable thing; she wanted the substance. And she was already
plaguing me for it.</p>

<p>God knows I gave her what I could give. Afterwards, when all was over,
she still had the memory of it. I hope she found comfort in it.</p>

<p>For of course it was precisely over that which was Evie's, and which I
was resolved to keep for Evie, that we were locked in a grapple. She
lisped and besought and cajoled. Before I began sometimes utterly to
forget that we were betrothed at all I could often have groaned aloud
at her inexpert playfulness; and I doubt whether the wit of man could
have devised a more acute torture than that which I now began to
undergo at her unsuspecting hands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>For Archie's birthday was early in March, and already the crocuses
were out, and the barrows in the streets were so aflame with daffodils
that the flowers almost illuminated the faces of the sellers of them.
It was still cold and backward, but the days were long past the turn,
and while single twigs were still of a wintry iron hue, in the mass
they took a softness, and the vistas of the parks had perceptibly
changed. In the streets of the wealthy in which I walked the
house-painters were at work, painting doors and railings and
window-boxes; and even at my King's Cross corner the railway
companies' announcements told of the coming summer. Spring was
breaking in London&mdash;spring, the merry time of the year&mdash;spring, when
lovers cannot keep asunder&mdash;and when Kitty and myself could not, yet
must, keep asunder.</p>

<p>In the streets I knew I was fairly safe. Her hand on my sleeve filled
me with no repugnance. Let me, for example, tell you of our walk back
to Percy Street on that night of Archie's birthday-party.</p>

<p>As we crossed Tottenham Court Road she slipped her hand into my
overcoat pocket, and my own encountered it there. It held it. It
retained it along dark Percy Street, and still retained it when we
stopped together at the side door next the window with the two
fly-blown hats on pedestals that formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> the whole of the modiste's
display. There I would have left her; but "Don't go just yet, Jeff,"
she begged; "just eentie walk?"</p>

<p>"Well, a short one," I said.</p>

<p>We turned up Fitzroy Street into the Marylebone Road, but I was wary
of the dark empty spaces about Regent's Park. The streets and the
crowds for me. Indeed I may say that during this period of our
"walking out" no couple in London sought solitude as I sought to avoid
it; and I resolutely suppressed the thought of what was going to
happen when the warm days should come and she should ask me to take
her to Richmond or Epping or Kew. It was no good meeting that horror
half way.</p>

<p>Therefore. "Well," I said, as we approached Portland Road Station
again, "hadn't we better be turning? It's getting late."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," she sighed reluctantly, with a pressure of my arm.
"Let's go this way."</p>

<p>She indicated one of the darker side streets. We took it.</p>

<p>By-and-by we stood by the modiste's window again. That is not a very
reputable neighbourhood, and as she stood there, lingering out our
talk to the thinnest of excuses, I guessed what was in her mind. But
the general environment of laxity only produced a primness in her. In
being all that she should be, she was sometimes a good deal more.
Still, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> was no harm in dallying with a secret thought.</p>

<p>But under all circumstances she ever displayed a sort of tempted
prudishness.</p>

<p>"You and Evie and Miss Soames must come in one Sunday and have tea
with me," she said resignedly at last, allowing the thought that some
day I might go up with her to recede.</p>

<p>"That will be charming," I replied.</p>

<p>Then she sighed. "It has been so lovely tonight!"</p>

<p>"In what way?" I asked, forcing a smile.</p>

<p>"Archie was horrid, and you, Jeff&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Yes, I remembered that hostility to Archie certainly had resulted in a
<i>rapprochement</i> between ourselves.</p>

<p>"Well," she said at last, lifting her face, "good-night, dearest&mdash;I
know who <i>I</i> shall dream of!"</p>

<p>I kissed her, heard the sound of her key in the lock, and, turning,
saw her little face still looking through the half-closed door after
me. I returned to King's Cross by way of Woburn Place, but there was
only a glimmer of light within the fanlight of Evie's dwelling as I
passed. Perhaps Archie had chosen the whisky and soda after all.</p>

<p>I soon saw that only by means of a studied unemotionalness should I be
able for long to head her off from the things she sought; and I set
about the creation of this atmosphere without loss of time. In this I
found my far-reaching ambition useful to me;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> I had simply to be
preoccupied with business to be spared much. I had not to play this
part. I actually was a ferment of new plans. That my absorbing
ambition was all for her sake was allowed to pass as understood. And
when she began to make touching attempts to be interested in my
affairs, I, lest a worse thing should befall me, encouraged her. I
talked fully and freely, knowing that I ran no more risk of betrayal
than Napoleon did when he laid before a Russian peasant woman
unacquainted with French the plan of campaign he feared to trust to
his own staff. This I did as the almonds pushed forth their pink, and
the plane-trees budded, and the building birds sang loudly. Once she
called me her building bird.</p>

<p>I had had to tell her, vaguely, about my employment; and I was also
vague about where I lived. Here her own tempted timorousness helped
me. It was not difficult for me to be stern about the proprieties, and
indeed, as she saw this, and began to feel perfectly safe with me, she
even affected a liberality of thought. "Why not?" she would sometimes
ask almost defiantly; "why not see one another in our own places&mdash;if
there was nothing horrid?"</p>

<p>And for that I usually found a surprised stare answer enough.</p>

<p>But the hunger was on her, and I had to give her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> morsels. That was a
haggard horror. It was the more horrible that her vanities always
turned on the things of which she had the least reason to be vain. As
an affectionate and devoted and dull spinster my heart was often soft
to her; but her coquetries would have made an angel groan. For
example: her hands were not remarkably pretty; her fingers had almost
the pinkness, and a little of the shape, of the smaller claws of a
freshly boiled crab; but she gave them no rest from display. I was
sometimes commanded, with a vapid imperiousness, to make much of them.
And once, on a seat on the Embankment, she yielded to a temptation
never far removed from her. It was at night; unnoticed, a portion of
her hair had shaken loose; and, suddenly becoming aware of this, and
doubtless with some idea of maddening me with the thought of something
prohibited, she put up her hands, shook down the short mass on her
shoulders, and grimaced at me. The next day she begged, with a shamed
face, that I would try to forget this sin in her&mdash;for apparently she
had intended it as sin; but I had nothing to forget. All that I
remembered was the contrast, as she had put the hair up again, between
the bosom under her uplifted arms and that other bosom from which
Archie Merridew had turned away as Evie had stood before the
mantelpiece mirror in Woburn Place.</p>

<p>Her dwelling, which I first visited with Evie and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> her aunt, was on
the first floor of the modiste's at the back. Her sleeping apartment I
never saw; and of her sitting-room I have no very clear memory now.
There was a penny-in-the-slot gas-meter on the landing, I remember,
and the floor of the room into which one walked was covered with a
greenish jute "art square," with the wide spaces of bare boarding
about it stained with Condy's Fluid. The previous occupant had left on
the walls a "French boudoir" paper with a pattern of thin vertical
lines and tiny garlands of pink rosebuds (Kitty had cleaned it with
dough on taking possession). The furniture was scanty, with a good
deal of muslin about it, and a sewing-machine stood in the back
window, which looked over a restaurant yard. When she had more than
two visitors at once she had to fetch an extra chair from her bedroom,
and from the sound her heels made at these times I gathered that that
room was uncarpeted.</p>

<p>As by quickening degrees she began to accept her unlooked-for
situation more as a matter of course, her thoughts naturally turned to
the future and that I found to involve her whole attitude to Life. The
things we were to do "when we were married" were dictated by the
narrowness of her outlook. She had about a pound a week of her own
money, I don't know exactly where from, but I think from some tramways
Edgbaston way, and this sum, together with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> whatever she might be able
to earn for herself, was practically the limit of her conception of
any income she was ever likely to have. From the stories she told me
of her earlier years I gathered that she came from a social stratum in
which the men are lords indeed, sometimes "in work," sometimes "out,"
and apparently content during these last vicissitudes to be dependent
on their wives or sisters or mothers. It seemed to me such a pitiful
little world, of milliners, lodging-house keepers, music-mistresses,
fancy needlewomen and daughters in offices; and I was given the
corresponding male standing. As with the men her cousins (her nearest
relatives) had married, if I should ever happen to earn money, well
and good; if not, so much the worse. She reckoned only on her weekly
pound and her own efforts. And as I learned that Cousin Alf and Cousin
Frank were boundlessly optimistic, and looked forward to a future no
less bright than that of which I felt the certitude within me, I soon
discovered that I was merely indulged in what in her heart she set
down as vapourings. It was the woman who, in her experience, "kept the
home together," and she was prepared to keep me.</p>

<p>"Well," I laughed, "I daresay I shall learn to pare the potatoes as
well as Cousin Alf in time."</p>

<p>But she smiled a sad, wise little smile. I might joke, but she knew.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>"And it's just possible that some time or other I may make a pound or
two," I said, smiling back.</p>

<p>"There'll be your clothes and pocket-money," she replied.</p>

<p>So I was to be kept&mdash;kept by virtue of my masculinity, as one keeps a
dog to bark. I was to be kept, I divined, somewhere in a suburb, in a
house the smallness of the rent of which would be exactly balanced by
the increased cost of the season ticket that would take me daily to my
work, when I was "in." Even when I was "out" I was to be treated with
a nice consideration, for she "never had liked to see Frank washing
up&mdash;it looked so unmanly," but as she said nothing about cleaning
boots or fetching coals, these things apparently were not unmanly. And
I wondered whether the Alfs and Franks were more numerous than I had
thought, or were becoming so. Small wonder their women treated them
with almost contemptuous tolerance, blazing out once in a while into a
row. And I now see that in this sense I wronged Kitty when I said she
was one of Life's takers. There are always two sides to a thing, and
on this side she wanted nothing but to give.</p>

<p>But, willing as she was to do all this in the future, I soon
discovered that she wanted her small solatium in the present. In the
matter of little treats and outings I did not compare very favourably
even with her Franks and Alfs. As you know, I simply had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> not the
necessary shillings. And so I began (I knew) to appear "near" and
"close" to her. One Friday evening, as we left the college together,
she allowed as much to be seen.</p>

<p>"Jeff," she said suddenly, as we approached the corner by the Oxford
together, "do you know, you've never taken me to a theatre yet!"</p>

<p>Personally I have never greatly cared for the theatre; but it happened
that I had spoken to her once or twice rather off-handedly that
evening, and was not unwilling to make amends. Besides, the theatre
might save a walk in Hyde Park. I pumped up a vivacity.</p>

<p>"No more I have," I replied. "Good idea. It's too late to go to-night,
but we might have a walk round and see what's on."</p>

<p>She fell in with the suggestion gleefully, and we walked down Charing
Cross Road and Shaftesbury Avenue, looking at theatre announcements as
we went. At the Circus we turned along Coventry Street, and presently
found ourselves opposite the Prince of Wales'. I think it was <i>La
Poupee</i> that was running there; if it wasn't it was some other piece
that seemed light; and as I like, when I do go to the theatre, to be
amused rather than instructed, I plumped for <i>La Poupee</i> as against
Kitty's suggestion&mdash;some stern and ennobling tragedy. I had drawn my
week's money that evening. It would be a sorry business if,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> with all
those years of Alfing and Franking before me, I could not once in a
while spare five shillings out of my eighteen; and so we elected for
<i>La Poupee</i> for the following evening.</p>

<p>We went. We waited for perhaps two hours outside the pit door, but, as
Kitty said when at last we did get inside, our places were worth it.
When we were married, she said, we ought to be able to afford at least
one theatre a month&mdash;she didn't in the least mind going to the
gallery&mdash;and it would be something to think about for the next month.
She didn't intend, when we were married, to get rusty. We were going
to have our little outings like other married people, and if I
continued, when we were married, to like light things and she serious
pieces, we would choose in turn. And so on. I only half heard. I was
spreading my remaining ten shillings over the week to come&mdash;ten
shillings, mark you, not thirteen, for I had had to buy Kitty a ring,
for which I was paying at the rate of three shillings a week.</p>

<p>Nothing happened at that performance of <i>La Poupee</i>. I am merely
telling you this in order that you may see exactly how we stood, not
at the crisis of our lives, but during the intervening stretches. I
added to the problem of the coming week by giving a shilling for a box
of chocolates, and no extravagance I have ever committed brought me a
richer return than Kitty's look of pleasure. I suppose that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> really
this was all that was demanded of Alf and Frank&mdash;a trifling,
unexpected superfluity once in a while. Lucky fellows! I, however, was
neither a Frank nor an Alf, my dreams were not the mere beguilings of
an idleness; and neither during my courtship (my real one, I mean) nor
thereafter was I going, in any woman's heart, to lord it on so
little.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p><br></p>
<h3>V</h3>

<p>I remember the Sunday on which Evie, Miss Angela and I first took tea
with Kitty Windus for two reasons. The first was that Miss Angela, who
at first had begged to be excused, had come after all (knocking on the
head my plan of walking back with Evie alone). And the second was
Kitty's asking me to remain behind after the others had taken their
departure.</p>

<p>We had gone at four o'clock; and even as the three of us had walked
towards Percy Street together (I had picked the others up on my way) I
had wondered what had suddenly come over Evie. She had seemed pale and
jumpy and morose, and had scarcely spoken a word during the whole of
our walk. Nor had she said very much more as we had eaten the hot
muffins and drunk the tea Kitty had provided. Indeed, the greater part
of the talk had been between Miss Angela and myself, and even that had
languished.</p>

<p>Then suddenly Miss Angela had said something that had, I thought,
explained matters. Archie's father, whose illness Miss Angela had
asked about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> on the evening of the birthday-party, had taken a sudden
turn for the worse, and Archie had been summoned to Guildford the day
before.</p>

<p>"Well, we must hope for the best," Miss Angela had concluded. "There's
no need to begin moping yet, child&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Angela also had jumped at my own explanation of Evie's
moodiness&mdash;that now that Archie was in trouble his misdoings were
forgotten.</p>

<p>I was to learn my error half-an-hour later, when Evie and her aunt
rose to depart.</p>

<p>I, of course, had intended to leave with them; but as I held the door
open for them to pass out Kitty said: "You stay for a few minutes,
Jeff; I've something to tell you.... Good-bye, Evie dear. I do hope
your cold will soon be well, Miss Soames&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And she waved her hand to them as they passed down the stairs.</p>

<p>I swore under my breath, but there was no help for it. I followed
Kitty back into her sitting-room. She crossed to the fireplace and
sank into a canvas deck-chair with her back to the sewing-machine. I
remained standing, with my hat in my hand, at the other corner of the
mantelpiece.</p>

<p>She had allowed her head to fall back against the sagging canvas, and
had closed her eyes.</p>

<p>"Sit down," she said, without opening her eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> and, wondering what
was wrong, I reached for her bedroom chair and sat down.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" I asked, a little alarmed already, though I knew
not why. I wondered if anything had been discovered about myself.
There were, as you know, plenty of such things to discover.</p>

<p>Her eyes still remained closed, but her head fell a little on one
side. It was not until I had asked her again what was the matter that
she spoke.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;it's dreadful!" she moaned. "I&mdash;I can see you haven't
heard&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is? Come, come!" I said, with some concern but more impatience.
"No, I've not heard anything to take on like this about&mdash;unless you
mean something about Archie's father?..."</p>

<p>"No, it's nothing to do with Archie's father. Oh, I can't possibly
tell you, Jeff&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was on the tip of my tongue to say that in that case it was of
little use my remaining; but she went on.</p>

<p>"Just a minute," she said. "You haven't heard ... about Louie
Causton?"</p>

<p>I was certainly surprised. You will remember that I had not set eyes
on Miss Causton since the evening of the breaking-up party, when she
had danced twice round the room with me, sought me out again
subsequently, and told me what the result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> had since falsified&mdash;that
she was returning to the college in the new term.</p>

<p>"No," I said abruptly. "What about her? Nothing wrong, I hope?"</p>

<p>But she only sobbed, "Oh, Jeff!" and with her eyes still closed put
out a helpless hand.</p>

<p>I had to approach and take the hand before I learned what the mystery
was. I don't know whether you have already guessed it. I hadn't, but
for all that my surprise, great as it was, passed even in the moment
of Kitty's broken whispering in my ear. I had known Louie Causton for
a deep, still pool; I don't think any revelation whatever could have
added to my respect for her powers of irony and nonchalance; and yet
when I say that my surprise passed it passed only to return. Good
gracious!... I seemed to hear her carefully lackadaisical voice again
as she had munched nougat: "So long since I've seen a man, my dear"
... and other circumstances, unmarked at the time, flashed on me now.</p>

<p>A child!</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" I breathed again in consternation.</p>

<p>My next thought was of Evie.</p>

<p>I was kneeling by Kitty's chair, holding her hand. I asked quickly:</p>

<p>"Does Evie know of this?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And does she know you're telling me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And of course Miss Soames does not know?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"She thinks as I thought, that it's about Archie's father Evie's so
upset?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but perhaps she is about that too a little. I'm horribly upset,
Jeff."</p>

<p>This last I took as a hint that the effect of this very startling
intelligence on Evie was not the first thing to be considered.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes.... I see...." I murmured.</p>

<p>We were silent, and I felt Kitty's fingers move within my grasp. They
pressed mine more closely.</p>

<p>"Don't leave me just yet, Jeff," she begged faintly. She was genuinely
prostrated.</p>

<p>"No, no," I said. "Let me think for a minute...."</p>

<p>The next moment my brain was buzzing with thought.</p>

<p>I knew that only some such contact with plain raw actuality as this
had been lacking in order to make Evie's transition from girlhood to
womanhood complete. No longer now was she the fair young tree standing
over its sprinkling of delicate discarded sheaths; this puff of Life's
east wind had carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> away the last of them. She had heard of these
things, and so in a sense knew of them; but that somebody she knew ...
that it should have come so near ... yes, poor shocked heart, that
finished it. Archie's insupportable vanities had begun her
enlightenment; the menace of his father's condition had touched her
with the fringe of its shadow; and now this revelation had come upon
her.</p>

<p>Mr Merridew's illness, moreover, had a plainly seen peril for me. I
knew that if anything happened Archie would immediately have enough
money to marry on, and my own labours&mdash;all that I had planned and done
from the first moment of my loving her to this present hour when I sat
in Kitty Windus' back room holding Kitty's hand&mdash;would go for nothing.
They, Evie and Archie, would probably marry, and I&mdash;I knew this in
that moment for a certainty&mdash;I, from sheer yielding, should find
myself married to Kitty Windus the moment I could scrape the money
together.</p>

<p>I gave a soft groan. I don't know whether Kitty supposed my groan the
commiseration for Louie Causton.</p>

<p>Yet what else, if I had chosen a different line, could I have done?
Nothing! My shrinking heart cried, Nothing! What was I to have spoken
to a young girl of marriage? An Agency clerk&mdash;with dazzling hopes! A
dweller over a sordid public-house&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> a dreamer of visions! The
possessor of a single suit of presentable clothes, the knees of which
I was even now deteriorating past remedy&mdash;and of a heart tapestried
with purple and gold, filled with an almost insensate ambition!</p>

<p>And I saw Evie only at all on the well-nigh insupportable footing that
I was the betrothed of Kitty Windus!</p>

<p>Oh, if I had but had two suits of clothes, and thirty-six shillings a
week instead of eighteen shillings, I think I would have cut the knot
there and then and have sought Evie out that very night and asked her
to marry me!</p>

<p>Then after a time I became more practical. Things, even the
heart-breaking small things of my life, were after all slowly
changing. One of these things was that my slavery at Rixon Tebb &amp;
Masters' was already promising to draw to a close. I have not yet
spoken of this. Let me do so, briefly, now.</p>

<p>Once more I had been looking for a billet elsewhere, and this time I
had excellent hopes of success. The post for which I had applied would
not be vacant for six weeks yet, but I had forced a personal interview
with one of my prospective employers, and had done what I had intended
to do&mdash;impressed him strongly with a sense of my mental capacity. He
had promised me his interest, and, unless he forgot it again (which,
of course, was not impossible),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> I might have at least enough for one
to live on before long. And once more my wider hopes were, I knew in
my soul, not illusions. Soon there would remain only the bond that
tied me to Kitty, and, with that broken, I would no longer envy even
Archie Merridew that luck and weak charm of his that in the past had
so often seemed more valuable than all I possessed.</p>

<p>But Kitty, lying back in her deck-chair, had opened her eyes again.
They were full of softness and fright. She spoke.</p>

<p>"I wonder, Jeff&mdash;whether&mdash;&mdash;" she said timidly and stopped.</p>

<p>"You wonder what, Kitty?" I asked gently.</p>

<p>"I know how strict you are&mdash;and if you say no I won't&mdash;but if I might
go and see her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Causton?"</p>

<p>"Not if you don't wish it, Jeff&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I considered.</p>

<p>"Has she asked you to go?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but if you wouldn't mind&mdash;very much&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It mattered little to me, but I had to pretend to ponder deeply.</p>

<p>I really don't know whether I felt sorrow for Miss Causton or not. She
was altogether beyond my comprehension. For all I knew my sorrow might
be an impertinence. So I must seem to ponder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is she?" I asked.</p>

<p>"She's taken rooms in Putney."</p>

<p>"Alone?" I asked, with a quick glance at Kitty.</p>

<p>"Oh yes!... Until June or July, that is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is then that she expects&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes.... And I thought, Jeff, that perhaps next Saturday&mdash;we shall be
out that way&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>We had arranged a little excursion for the following Saturday, the
four of us&mdash;Evie and Archie, and Kitty and myself. We were to wander
on Wimbledon Common.</p>

<p>"I never really knew her well, Jeff, understood her, I mean," she went
on, "but after all I did see a good deal of her. It's horrible, when I
remember the things she used to say.... And&mdash;and&mdash;you've made such a
difference to me, darling&mdash;I wasn't going&mdash;to be married&mdash;before.... I
should like to go, Jeff&mdash;just once," she begged.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't commit yourself to anything?"</p>

<p>"Oh no!"</p>

<p>"Does Evie want to go too?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No. She says she couldn't bear it. She cried half last night as it
is."</p>

<p>"Then you'd call on your way next Saturday, and meet the three of us
later?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Very well," I concluded. "You'd better go."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>She threw her arms impulsively about my neck.</p>

<p>Then a change came over her. I think the change began with the failure
of the supply of gas from the penny-in-the-slot meter. She had
arranged for her little party a pink tissue-paper shade about her
milky globe, an idea she had borrowed from Woburn Place; and slowly
its colour faded. I had several pennies in my pocket. Quickly I felt
for them.</p>

<p>But she moved closer to me. I was still on my knees by her deck-chair.</p>

<p>"Don't bother about it&mdash;just for once, Jeff," she murmured.</p>

<p>She could do it with impunity now. After what had passed our situation
could hardly be commonplace, and our nearness was as little
compromising as nearness ever can be. She luxuriated in her little
perilous letting-go&mdash;could toy with, and yet be immune from, a danger.</p>

<p>Slowly the gas expired, and the firelight glowed on the blue and white
check tablecloth and the disarray of tea-things upon it. On the back
wall of the restaurant yard was a square of orange light which the
shadow of a waiter's head crossed from time to time. I don't know that
with some men&mdash;Mackie, for instance&mdash;her position would have been all
she supposed it to be, but, poor heart, she had had little enough
experience from which to surmise that. And I myself could hardly be
said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> be there at all. She lay in my arms; and in whatever false
sweet fancies she lay endrowsed she was not alone. I had my torturing
vision too. It was neither of her nor of Louie Causton, that vision. I
was trying to persuade myself that she was another than Kitty Windus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p><br></p>
<h3>VI</h3>

<p>Of our visit to Wimbledon on the following Saturday I intend to say as
little as may be. When you have read it you will not, I know, ask my
reason.</p>

<p>Archie did not appear. This time he had cause enough. The wire which
was handed to me at Rixon Tebb &amp; Masters' a little before Saturday
midday (Polwhele brought it to me with a look that said plainly, "What
next?") announced that his father had died during the night, and he
had despatched it from Victoria Station on his way down to Guildford.
Instantly my heart leaped.</p>

<p>Kitty was going to see Miss Causton. If, this new tidings
notwithstanding, Evie would still keep to the engagement, I should
have an hour with her alone.</p>

<p>I persuaded Evie to come. At first she obstinately refused, but I had
the support of Miss Angela, to whom I privately whispered the
desirability of "taking her mind off it." We left Woburn Place, the
two of us, called for Kitty, and sought the Putney 'bus. Kitty left us
at the corner of a street off the New King's Road, and Evie and I
passed on to the bridge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>That was about four o'clock, and Kitty was to rejoin us near the
Windmill at an hour that would depend upon the length of her stay with
Miss Causton. She expected to be at the Windmill by five.</p>

<p>But at five there was no sign of her, nor had she appeared by
half-past five. At a little before six I said to Evie, "She'll know
we've gone on to the nearest place to tea, and will follow us. Let's
go&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Not far from the Windmill, on the Wimbledon side, there is a sort of
small hamlet, with cottages and alleys and split-oak palings, and a
refreshment house at the end of a garden. There Evie and I had tea,
and there we sat after tea, waiting for Kitty. I talked of this and
that, all very much away from the two subjects uppermost in her heart,
and by half-past six I had given Kitty up.</p>

<p>"She's missed us," I said. "We may happen to run across her, but it's
no good waiting here. Shall we take a turn before we go back?"</p>

<p>We left the refreshment-room, and walked among the gorse and birches
in the direction of Queen's Mere.</p>

<p>It was a green and amber evening, with the shadows already deepening
over Coombe Woods and the calling of homing rooks in the air. Here and
there in the glades family parties still continued to play games with
a ball that was quickly becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> difficult to see, and lovers
appeared among the coppices. The blackthorn was over, and the may hung
in sprays of delicate drooping buds; and in the south-west hung the
pale sickle of the new moon. Evie and I, saying little, dropped down a
steep over-grown alley that led to the mere, and it was in a sandy
bottom at the foot of the alley that I heard a distant rasping call.
Another call followed it, and then a throaty thrilling, and then
another short series of acrid and moving calls.</p>

<p>It was a nightingale.</p>

<p>By the time we had reached the motionless amber-green water it had
broken into full song.</p>

<p>I cannot tell&mdash;hitherto I have not attempted to tell&mdash;the mystery of
that eve and of the song with which it rang. I cannot speak&mdash;nor would
I if I could&mdash;of the responses that eve and that song called up in my
heart. It was, I think, for both of us as if that bird's voice cried
aloud all that we had left unuttered during the past few hours. Even
Louie Causton, even Archie's father, had their part in it. It was as
if that voice spoke of the feeble and infinitely moving wonder of
birth&mdash;of the impinging of that relentless shadow that closes all&mdash;and
of the griefs and joys and smarts and healings again of the brief
passage from that unknowing to this forgetting again. All this crowded
upon me in that exquisite agony of notes. And more came, until I could
hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> endure it. There was no poignancy, no utter melting and
surrender, that those importunate wellings did not give to the falling
night. The unattainable greatness of Life and our own puny reachings
forth for that greatness&mdash;Life's glory and the indignities of the
miserable livers of it&mdash;Life's majesty and the nosings and burrowings
of the fallen heirs to that majesty&mdash;all these shortcomings were
reconciled in the song; and what man would be, that for an hour he
was. I fail in expressing this; Evie, I am sure, did not seek to
express it; but in that loud and lost and anguished outpouring,
raptures and torments were folded together as in an Amen.... For one
moment only I shuddered; I had remembered that but for an accident I
might have stood by that water, listening to that song, with Kitty
Windus, but the physical convulsion passed, and the bird sang on.</p>

<p>I had not looked at Evie. I do not think she knew she had drawn a
little closer to me. Other listeners had been attracted by the melody,
but we stood in a shadow, near a rill that fell into the mere. The
water was nacre; the moon's sickle in it was a thin blade of amethyst;
and I thrilled unspeakably as the bird's song changed without warning
to long, low, caressing notes that drew the heart out of me as the
nectar-bag of a floret is drawn from a flower. I heard Evie's slow
sob.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh, might I but have crushed out that other nectar, to transmute into
honey of our own!</p>

<p>Suddenly Evie flung herself on my breast, sobbing and strangling. Her
fingers worked at the lapel of my collar; by bending my head I could
have touched her small white knuckles with my lips. I was conscious
that in my efforts not to do this I bared my teeth like a dog, but I
remembered in time that to snatch was to lose. It was not my bosom
against which her bosom heaved&mdash;it was the nearest sentient
resting-place on which she could lay it. Her unhappiness and her
happiness, her dream and her disillusion, her knowledge and her
already failing hopes, rushed together in her sobs. Her love of a
wastrel and her love for all he was a wastrel, and that hidden and
sacred nook from which Louie Causton had ruthlessly ripped the
curtain&mdash;for the pure strangeness of these things her tears gushed
forth. I felt the long heave of her body.</p>

<p>"Come, come, my dear!" I said, with an infinitude of tender
encouragement, close to her ear.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;oh!" she sobbed.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear girl!" I murmured, passing my arm about her to support
her.</p>

<p>But at that moment I could no more have said or done more than this
than I could have sued for a favour by the bier of a scarce-cold
lover.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hush, poor child!" I whispered, patting her shoulder. "Come, let's
go. Let's leave that dreadful bird."</p>

<p>"Just a&mdash;mi&mdash;mi&mdash;minute&mdash;&mdash;" she quavered. "I&mdash;I&mdash;love it&mdash;and I can't
bear it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Even so did I love, and yet could scarce bear to hold the tender form
in my arms.</p>

<p>Presently we left the mere, mounted the dark lane, and began to cross
the common. Her hand was now on my sleeve, and it did not leave it
again. Once her fingers made an impulsive little pressure on it,
which, I cried sternly to my heart, I must not regard. But God knows
the war there was between the sweetness of it and my fortitude.</p>

<p>"Jeff," she said more quietly by-and-by, using that name for the first
time. "I&mdash;I couldn't have borne it if it hadn't been for you. It was
too&mdash;too&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind, dear," I soothed her. "Let's walk a little more
quickly&mdash;your aunt will be wondering what's become of you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She laughed tremulously. "Kitty will be wondering what's become of
<i>you</i>," she said. Then she added timidly, "She's a lucky girl!"</p>

<p>"Oh? Why?" I asked.</p>

<p>"You're so&mdash;so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But she did not say what.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>We turned down Putney Hill.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" >

<p>I said I should say little of this, and I shall say no more. I took
her home, but did not go in with her, neither, though I ought to have
done so, did I seek Kitty. I went home, but all that I knew of my
getting there was that I found myself sitting, with my hat and coat
still on, on the edge of the bed in my red-and-green-lighted
apartment.</p>

<p>They were turning out from the public-house below when at last I rose
sluggishly and began to prepare for bed.</p>

<p>For half the following week I was outside and beyond myself.</p>

<p>But exactly a week, less a day, from that Saturday on which I had held
Evie in my arms there dropped a thunderbolt into my life. On that
Friday evening I had gone as usual to the cashier for my wages, and he
had paid me; but as I had turned away again with my eighteen shillings
he had said, as if giving utterance to an afterthought,
"Oh&mdash;Jeffries&mdash;we find we shall not require your services after this

<h3>I</h3>

<p>Poor, fussy, well-meaning Kitty had done it&mdash;had done it all
unwittingly. In telling her vaguely where I lived I had left the
number of my house unspecified, and when a letter had come for me to
the Business College on an evening when I had announced my intention
of being away, she, inspired by the urgency of my affairs, had got a
directory and readdressed the letter to me at Rixon Tebb &amp; Masters'.
It was a letter from the firm into whose service I hoped soon to
enter, and I examined the flap of the envelope carefully when finally
it did come into my hands. Polwhele (I have little doubt it was he)
had steamed it open, read it and closed it again.</p>

<p>This time all I could get out of Gayns, whom I once more approached,
was that Rixon Tebb &amp; Masters' had no use for an employee whose mind
was already elsewhere.</p>

<p>It was true that the sack from Rixon Tebb &amp; Masters' was not now a
matter of the first importance. That was not the thunderbolt. Scanty
as my wages were I had still saved up nearly three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> pounds out of
them; and, as the letter that Polwhele had tampered with contained the
news that I might hold myself in readiness to begin my new work a
month from that date, the sum was enough to tide me over. But the
letter had a postscript. This was a merely formal intimation that it
was assumed that I could produce the usual references of steadiness,
reliability and so forth. I myself never dreamed that I should be
denied them.</p>

<p>I was denied them, however, by Polwhele.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but," I stammered, aghast.</p>

<p>Polwhele referred me to my real employers, the Agency. I gave him a
long and gradually lowering stare.</p>

<p>"Do you mean&mdash;&mdash;" I began slowly.</p>

<p>"I mean what I say," he snapped; and as he turned away he added in a
lower voice, "You ain't surprised, are you?"</p>

<p>And, remembering how I had seen him with his fingers in Mr Masters'
waste-paper basket, I could not say I was.</p>

<p>Again I sought Gayns. This time the cashier flew into a passion.</p>

<p>"Confound you!" he cried. "You're more trouble than all the rest of
them put together! What is it now? A character? Oh yes, you can have a
character! I'd advise you not to show it to anybody, though! First
leaving us&mdash;then coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> back&mdash;then days off&mdash;then dickering with
other firms! Go to Polwhele&mdash;go to the Agency&mdash;go to hell!"</p>

<p>I left Rixon Tebb &amp; Masters' without references.</p>

<p>Without references my new firm refused to have anything whatever to do
with me.</p>

<p>I come now to the deepest slough of my poverty.</p>

<p>It was early in the month of June that I was thrown out of work, with
thirty-five shillings in my pocket. The drizzling winter had given
place to a glorious early summer, and the days increased in heat until
they became torrid. Men walked Piccadilly at night in evening dress,
with their light dust-coats thrown over their arms; and ragged urchins
hailed the appearance of watercarts with whoops of joy and danced
barelegged in the refreshing puddles behind them. Horses wore straw
bonnets, out of which their ears stuck ludicrously up; in whole
districts the water supply began to be cut off at certain hours of the
day; the pitiless sun gave every street the appearance of a hard, hot
snapshot; and, as the heat got on people's nerves, the cries of
children at play became intolerably strident.</p>

<p>My corner at King's Cross was well-nigh insupportable. Why the
quantity of torn paper in the gutters should redouble the moment the
sun begins to glare on London I do not know, unless it be that the
fried fish and ready-cooked provision businesses suddenly boom; and
certainly the refuse in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> I frequently walked ankle-deep was
mostly heavy with grease. Even had I been able to afford it, my
"pull-up" had now become such a stove that I do not think I could have
entered it. I dined, or rather supped, late at night, at one of the
coffee-stalls where the electric trams now sweep round from Gray's Inn
Road to St Pancras Station; and I breakfasted (my only other meal) on
bread and the water I drew from my tap on the landing before it was
cut off. The council didn't save much in my case by cutting the supply
off. I filled every vessel I could lay my hands on early in the
morning. As Miss Causton had once said, one must be clean, and Archie,
whose bath I could now have passed my days in, was seldom to be found
in his rooms near the Foundling Hospital now.</p>

<p>For three weeks I trudged the streets looking for work; and then a bit
of luck befell me. The new "professor" at the college broke down under
the heat; it was not desired to give up the Friday evening
advertisement-writing class; and I daresay my anomalous standing at
the place, something between student and pathetic high-and-dry
"institution," was the cause of its being offered to me. I got five
shillings for the evening, and that five shillings kept me for five
days. I discovered that I need not pay my rent. The first week I
missed doing this I made a shamefaced apology to my landlord, the
publican,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> and discovered that he was not a bad sort. It was too hot
to worry about trifles, he said, and so set himself a precedent that
cost him pretty dearly until, long afterwards, I saw to it that he was
not the loser for having harboured me during that time.</p>

<p>Wherever I sought work my inability to produce a character damned me;
and on the other hand I was not a Discharged Prisoner. Two or three
times I was taken on casually, once as a packer at a large furniture
emporium, once at a stocktaking for bankruptcy purposes, and once (I
forget how I tumbled into this) I spent a whole day locked in an upper
room of a town hall, counting the voting-papers in some borough or
vestry election&mdash;a lucrative ten-shilling job. This was before I got,
and retained for some weeks (until I had the Corps of Commissionaires
down on me), the post of hall porter at the offices of a sporting
paper. I will tell you about that presently. You will see that I am
making all the haste I can to have done with this horrible time.</p>

<p>Among other things, the general deterioration in my appearance had
forced me to tell Kitty Windus that I was out of work. But I had made
light of it, saying that, on the whole, it was rather a good thing, as
I needed some sort of a spur; but I daresay Alf and Frank had said the
same thing many a time. Presently my former boastings, about the great
things I was shortly going to do, had committed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> me to the lie that I
had at last found employment. It was my week's stocktaking that I told
this particular lie about, and Kitty never knew when that temporary
job came to an end. Nor, poor girl, did I tell her what she had done
when she had forwarded that letter to Rixon Tebb &amp; Masters'. It would
become me ill to say that she stuck to me because it was myself or
nothing for her; already I had begun to dread that it would be no easy
matter to get rid of her when I might find it necessary to do so: and
many a time, as my despair grew upon me, sweeping all personal
reluctances and physical repugnances aside, I threw pride to the
winds, and ate, in her sitting-room in Percy Street, the only food I
had tasted during the day&mdash;becoming an Alf or a Frank in very fact.</p>

<p>For&mdash;perhaps this was partly the effect of the unrelenting heat&mdash;her
insipid coquetries had begun to exasperate me more and more. I became
increasingly petulant when I was commanded to "tiss eentie finger" and
to look into the little scalene triangles of her eyes and say that I
loved her. Presently, I am afraid, I began to cause her many tears. We
wrangled frequently. I was "near," I was "close," I did not treat her
as other engaged girls were treated, I never took her anywhere except
for a bus ride, or to a cheap theatre once in a blue moon.</p>

<p>Then one day, without warning, she brought it up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> against me that I
had "given her the slip" that afternoon on Wimbledon Common.</p>

<p>Of this I was technically so innocent, but morally so entirely guilty,
that I broke out into anger, and there was a scene.</p>

<p>"I know some girls are younger and prettier than I am," she broke out,
with unbridled temper, "but you <i>did</i> ask me to marry you after all."</p>

<p>"So I did," I admitted, in a tone that made her flame.</p>

<p>"Yes," she cried shrilly. "And not only that&mdash;I've seen you looking at
Louie Causton too."</p>

<p>"Oh?" I said, noting with relief that her jealousy was not specially
of Evie. "Well, there are one or two pleasing points about her."</p>

<p>"And she was the only one you danced with at the party."</p>

<p>"Before I asked you to marry me?"</p>

<p>"And me&mdash;you've never <i>once</i> taken me to a dance, though I've <i>seen</i>
Rachel Levey offer you tickets."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you've seen me look at Miss Levey too?"</p>

<p>"And you never spoke to me, and sat behind the books with Louie."</p>

<p>"Well, there only remains one other suggestion for you to make."</p>

<p>And so on. It was degrading in the extreme. But I was sufficiently
punished for it later, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> she lay with her head on my breast,
sobbing out phrases of contrition for her vindictive temper and
supplication for pardon.</p>

<p>All, all gone now was the hour of exaltation in which I had heard the
nightingale sing and had felt my glowing girl's breast heaving against
my own. I was a hungry, desperate man, living a life against which I
knew I should not be able to bear up indefinitely, and already
glancing into the public-house as I entered by my side door and
beginning to wonder whether they were not wiser than I who made use of
the anodyne of drink. Why not drink, and forget for at least an hour?
And one night, meeting Mackie again, and having eaten little, I did
succumb, and for the first time in my life got drunk. I got drunk at
his expense. He had heard the news of Louie Causton, and wanted to
talk about it. I, like a cur, let him.... I broke away from him at
last, but not until my loosened tongue had said I know not what.</p>

<p>My relation with Evie during this time is difficult to define. She
never quite put me back again into the place I had occupied before
that Saturday when we had heard the nightingale together, but newer
preoccupations overlay this relation. Archie now had money (I never
knew quite how much) at his command; but he still showed no sign of
putting it to the use Miss Angela, if not I, had expected&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> of
entering into a formal engagement with Evie. Miss Angela found excuses
for this out of her own imagination&mdash;that his father had only lately
died, and so on; but I could have set her right even then. I knew how
things were drifting. From the little I remembered of my talk with
Mackie, Archie had found in his coming into money quite another
opportunity. What might have facilitated his marriage with Evie
actually delayed it. He was getting rid of his money in Leicester
Square again.</p>

<p>So Evie's name was associated with his, and yet there was no plighting
between them, and Evie swayed, now happy but with a fear, now
despairing, but not hopelessly so. There was no trouble she could have
brought openly to me even had she wished, but nevertheless she often
turned to me significantly full of silence. She, Kitty and I often
walked homewards together through the sweltering streets, and when
Evie had left us Kitty would speak her mind freely about Archie
Merridew.</p>

<p>"He's one of the Jewness Dorey now!" she exclaimed one evening, taking
the phrase, I don't doubt, from one of her "better class" novels. "And
it's no good saying it's got nothing to do with us! I think <i>you</i>
ought to give him a talking-to!"</p>

<p>This was in the typewriting-room of the college, within ten minutes of
the close of an advertisement-writing evening.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>"What can I say to him?" I asked. "It's no business of mine." She
little knew how much I had made it my business.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's just like a man!" she said impatiently, all aglow with the
<i>esprit de sexe</i>. "The poor child's moping and fretting, and you say
it's no business of yours! Of course it's the business of <i>all</i> her
friends!"</p>

<p>"Of all her women friends, maybe," I answered. "Well, if that's so,
why don't you and Miss Angela have a talk about it?"</p>

<p>"As if we hadn't&mdash;twenty!" she cried. "You and your bright ideas. It
isn't fair&mdash;it <i>isn't</i> fair to Evie!"</p>

<p>"But what is it you hope for?" I asked.</p>

<p>She stared. "Why, that he'll marry her, of course!"</p>

<p>"Quite so. But I don't mean that. I mean, do you and Miss Angela think
you can bring any pressure to bear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do&mdash;young idiot!" she broke out. "He ought to be ashamed of
himself!"</p>

<p>And I didn't doubt that a certain amount of pressure might be brought
to bear. If it was made less trouble for Archie to marry than not to
marry, he would probably marry. He had not manhood enough, if it was
clearly shown that marriage was expected of him, to hold out. And I
knew how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> those marriages turned out.... I meditated.</p>

<p>"But," I objected, "why meddle? You know what a marriage of that kind
would be! You see what he is anyway!"</p>

<p>But here I had touched Kitty's limitation. For her, as for her novels,
marriage was the end of the story. If joybells closed it nothing after
that mattered, and the look she gave me was a personal confirmation.</p>

<p>"But," she went on presently, "you could help, Jeff. We women can't
talk to him&mdash;though he's not getting very many smiles from <i>me</i> just
now!"</p>

<p>I smiled. "You're an unscrupulous crew," I remarked.</p>

<p>"Will you see him?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I won't say I won't."</p>

<p>"But <i>will</i> you?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;if I see a fitting opportunity."</p>

<p>"A fitting. Look!" Her voice dropped. Evie had just come into the
typewriting-room on her way to wash her hands before leaving. "I'll
tell you what," Kitty said quickly; "you go along with her now. See if
it isn't as I say. Then tell me whether you won't give that little
idiot a dressing-down at once."</p>

<p>She had quite forgotten that twinge of jealousy that had been the
cause of our recent scene. If she hadn't, the more honour to her sense
of sex comradeship.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> It was about this time that I was beginning quite
frequently to forget that our relation was that of lovers, and as long
as I could forget that, she had pathetic little magnanimities that I
even admired.</p>

<p>"All right, if you wish it," I said.</p>

<p>So for once Evie's society was absolutely thrust upon me.</p>

<p>That night she was all that Kitty had said&mdash;plunged in despondency.
She was, of course, "in love with" Archie, but that after all is only
a generic expression. Even love comes down to cases, and I think that
in her case, even then, she was wondering whether, had things happened
a little differently, she might not have been equally "in love" with
somebody else. Of that I myself had never a doubt. With Archie's
money, or even a decent job, I would have flouted the whole world in
my triumphant security that I could make her mine. And I should do so
yet. Though for the present my power might go a-begging, I vowed that
it should yet be taken and richly paid for. The dark and solid houses
were less solid than that something I knew to be within myself, that
makes and unmakes houses and streets and towns and lands.... But
gently, gently; I was not out of the mire yet; by-and-by would be time
enough for these boastings;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> things must go on as they were for a
little while longer.</p>

<p>So though I did not speak a word to her that night that bore directly
on the case as Kitty understood it, I did more. I did&mdash;I know this
now&mdash;make her feel that, glooms and delights apart, she had in me an
affectionate friend to whom she would not come with troubles in vain.
I have been told, and am inclined to believe it, that I have this
power with women.</p>

<p>And her eyes were soft with friendship as I left her.</p>

<p>"Good night, Jeff," she said fondly, as I took her hand. "I do like
being with you sometimes."</p>

<p>And that night, as I lay half suffocated in the room I did not even
pay rent for, the words rang like a chime in my head until the morning
noises marked the beginning of another torrid day.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" >

<p>The commissionaire's job I spoke of I got in an odd way. I got it
through the combination of my unusual size with unusual strength. I
was walking along Fleet Street that day when a horse fell, and I, with
others, helped to raise it again. When we had finished, a man at my
elbow spoke both casually and penetratingly.</p>

<p>"That was as good as anything I've seen for weeks," he said. "Have you
had much practice in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> holding a whole horse up while the others fasten
the buckles?"</p>

<p>I laughed. I had certainly had the heavy end of the job, but "Not
quite that," I said.</p>

<p>He gave me a scrutinising look. "Out o' work?" it seemed to say; but
he did not speak the words.</p>

<p>"Here, come and have a drink," he said.</p>

<p>His name was Pettinger. He was a sporting journalist, and so a judge
of "form" and "condition." I was not in the best of either, but I must
have struck him as having "the makings" of I don't quite know what. He
gave me a drink, which I didn't want, and a plate of sandwiches, which
I did want rather badly; and he also gave me, as I say, this
commissionaire's job. Pettinger is a friend of mine to this day; and
since he is a simple and lovable animal of a fellow (he fully concurs
in this description of himself) he is the only man I can bear to speak
much to about that time when, clad in a sky-blue uniform, I kept the
door of his newspaper office, touching my cap to proprietors, and
being jocularly prodded by sportsmen and journalists, as if I had been
an ox at Smithfield Show.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p><br></p>
<h3>II</h3>

<p>It was about this time that Archie Merridew's light was once more
beginning to show regularly, evening after evening, over the leads of
his top floor near the Foundling Hospital. This was after a period of
months during which his abode had been in complete darkness. But as
his visits to the college had become infrequent, and as I did not know
what he might be up to, I had kept away.</p>

<p>When, some little after my commission from Kitty, I did look him up
again, it was by no means that I might deliver Kitty's message. I
went, rather, as a matter of attention to detail. There were certain
things I could not afford not to know, and, more important, there were
certain appearances I could not afford not to keep up. Nevertheless I
did not dream with what consequences my visit of that evening would
presently be fraught.</p>

<p>I was in a state of great nervous irritability before I went. The
weather still continued almost insupportably hot, and to my other
discomforts had been added a new perturbation that worked on me none
the less that in all probability it was quite groundless. The evening
papers had started a scare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> about "low-flash oil"; my red and green
room was little cooler than a furnace; and I had lately begun to
glance at my cheap lamp from time to time as if it had been a bomb. I
mention this merely as an indication of the state to which I was
becoming reduced. I thought of that lamp, I remember, as I walked from
the college to Archie's rooms that night and half hoped in my
peevishness that the thing had exploded in my absence.</p>

<p>It was only ten o'clock, but Archie was already in bed. He wore blue
silk pyjamas and on a small table by the side of his bed stood a
medicine bottle and a siphon; but when I asked him whether he was ill
that he had need of these last he made light of them. It was this
beastly weather, he said, and perhaps the beastly weather also
accounted for his drinking the milk that Jane presently brought up in
a sealed bottle. When Jane had gone, Archie, with an attempt at his
old disarming impertinence, turned to me and said, "Well&mdash;how's the
blue uniform, Jeff?"</p>

<p>Ah! He knew of that!</p>

<p>"Didn't think I'd heard, did you?" he grinned. "Well, I only did hear
yesterday. Nothing to be ashamed of, old chap. I know one of your
fellows, you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I too knew the sub-editor whose name he mentioned. He was something of
a bird of the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> too. Already the fact that Archie knew of my
occupation had set me swiftly revolving the new dispositions I should
certainly have to make in my relation to Kitty and Evie.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," I said. "I shouldn't attempt to drink with the sub-editor
of a sporting paper if I were you. You've been trying, I expect," I
added, looking suspiciously at him. He seemed drawn and ill. He never
had any stamina.</p>

<p>"Sha'n't tell tales out of school," he replied, with another weak
attempt at his old facetiousness. "Well, how's the fair Kitty?"</p>

<p>Ill as he was, I could have boxed his ears for the tone of it, but I
answered his question, and he grinned again.</p>

<p>"Rare good sort," he said appreciatively. "Give us a splash of that
soda, and pass those cigarettes, Jeff...." Then, lighting a cigarette,
"Look here, you old scoundrel," he said, "I've got a crow to pluck
with you! Guess what it is?"</p>

<p>I could not.</p>

<p>"Well," he leered. "I saw Mackie the other night."</p>

<p>You will remember what had happened the last time I myself had seen
Mackie.</p>

<p>"So there!" he triumphed, after some recital or other that had for its
point my single fit of intoxication.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> "<i>Now</i> what about it, you old
humbug?" he demanded.</p>

<p>I knew I must keep my face and smile. I did not know why I must do
these things, but I did them, looking at him and noticing again how
sallow and changed he was. Then I looked about the room, mentally
commenting on the evidences of the patrimony that had done him so
little good&mdash;his new dressing-gown, his silver-topped bottles, and a
new travelling-case, these things thrown anyhow among his older
belongings. One of the newer objects I held in my hand; it was the
gold cigarette case I had passed him; and I gazed smiling at it as he
went on.</p>

<p>"Yes," he told me, with humorous accusation; "Mackie told me all about
it&mdash;ha ha ha! What price the old puritan Jeff now? Eh? Sad dog, sad
dog!"</p>

<p>I replied, quite calmly, that the dissipations of commissionaires were
limited by their circumstances.</p>

<p>"And what the devil are you doing being a commissionaire?" he
demanded. "I'll tell you what it was, Jeff," he continued familiarly,
"that failure in Method seems to me to have broken you all up. What
the dickens made you fail?"</p>

<p>I was conscious of an interior stirring of hate. What, indeed, had
made me fail!</p>

<p>"Oh, over-confidence, I suppose," I answered lightly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>And he continued to talk.</p>

<p>At last I rose and said good-night. He raised himself on one elbow in
order to shake hands.</p>

<p>"Come in again and see a chap soon," he said. "It's hellish slow up
here all alone."</p>

<p>I was already at the door, but I turned abruptly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I said. "Do you mean you're laid up? You said you
weren't."</p>

<p>But he only gave a confused little laugh. "Eh? Laid up? Of course not!
Can't a chap turn in early once in a while?"</p>

<p>"'Once in a while'?... But you said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That you might come in and see me? Well, do. No harm in that, is
there? Say I'm going slow for a bit, that's all," he added.</p>

<p>I agreed with him that to "go slow" for a bit was a course he might
with advantage have adopted some time ago, and, though considerably
puzzled, I turned slowly away.</p>

<p>My lamp, I discovered when I reached my dwelling again, had not
exploded in my absence; but I did not light it. This was not, of
course, through any actual fear; it was merely part of my general
nervous condition. I remember, as still further explaining that
condition, that I had passed a Board School that day as the children
had poured out for their morning recess of a quarter of an hour; I
have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> said how more than commonly strident the heat seemed to make all
noises; and at the sudden outburst of the children I had broken into a
copious flood of perspiration. I was not much steadier now. Pushing
the lamp aside I flung up my window as high as it would go, drew out
my old string-mended chair, and, sitting down, began to stare at the
"<i>Sarcey's Fluid</i>" advertisement across the way.</p>

<p>The rippling of its incandescents had a trick that always fascinated
and irritated me intensely. Before the last letter of the first word
was an apostrophe, but its single bright spot always appeared out of
its proper order. S&mdash;A&mdash;R&mdash;, and so on, the thing ran, but the whole
legend was complete before that apostrophe started into its place. I
used sometimes to watch as if I hoped the whole mechanism might
suddenly alter, but, of course, it never did. I began to watch it
again that night, while my ceiling and the wall above my bed became
red and green, red and green, red and green....</p>

<p>I am afraid that what I am now about to say I shall have to ask you to
take on trust. I have no evidence to offer of a phenomenon that, I am
told, is shared by madness and genius alike. Nor will I trouble you
either with any talk of prevision or of inner certitude, nor with the
gradually deepening brooding that led up to this phenomenon&mdash;the
brooding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span> over the countless slights and slurs and rubs I had suffered
from Archie Merridew's reckless and ignorant tongue ever since I have
known him&mdash;my appearance, my private affairs, the side-splitting joke
of Jeffries being in love. I will pass straight to the sudden and
complete illumination that, as I sat there, so irradiated my
intelligence that I wondered why it had come to me now, an hour later,
and not then, the moment I had seen him lying at that extraordinarily
early hour in bed.</p>

<p>It came, this flash of illumination, in exactly the same manner as the
changing of the electrograph before my eyes&mdash;and, as you will see in a
moment, with the same bloody apostrophe. And with its coming my room
was not more suffused with the crimson glare than my mind suddenly was
with the same morbid and flaming and dangerous hue.</p>

<p><i>I had suddenly realised what was really the matter with Archie.</i></p>

<p>Let me now tell you the kind of man I have sometimes, though possibly
mistakenly, supposed myself to be.</p>

<p>He has aspired, that man, I have sometimes supposed myself to be, to
the stars; but his feet have also known the burning bottom of the pit.
His heart has been lifted up until sometimes, through eyes drowned
with tears, he has had his poor and fragmentary glimpse of a larger
Fatherhood than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> earth knows; but he has also exchanged intelligence
with the devil. His heart has flowered with loves and charities; but
that same heart has also been a rock with a toad in it. He was born in
heaven, but has lodged in hell. So in him, according as he has been
used, have opposites met.</p>

<p>And yet, as I say, I may be wrong in supposing that I am this man.</p>

<p>Yet the man who, in my red and green room that night, leaped up from
his chair, and with a bursting, ringing cry shook his hand on high,
was not the James Herbert Jeffries who now writes this feverish
shorthand. He who writes the shorthand was not the same James Herbert
Jeffries who stood, with those violent dyes flooding his face, vowing
that if that sick young buyer of infected merchandise dreamed for one
instant of doing that which it was sought to make him do, and which
apparently he was ready to do, he should pay for it with the last
thing he had to give. That James Herbert Jeffries was plunged in that
hour into a place of stench and infernal brightness that God forbid
was ever his destined abode.</p>

<p>I cried aloud, shaking my fist up at my cracked and blackened ceiling:</p>

<p>"<i>Though Christ died for man in vain ... let him but think of it ...
let him ... let him ... and I....</i>"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>After that I passed into a curious state of mind. You have heard how I
make, when I can, anger serviceable to me, but here was an anger past
my bringing into control. Yet, as ordinarily I plan calmly, so was I
calm up to a certain point now. The result of these two things was
that my brain worked like a worn and cranky machine, sometimes doing
more than it ought, sometimes less; sometimes jerking startlingly
ahead, sometimes refusing to work at all. And as there was thus no
continuity in my thought, and as my recollections are curiously
associated with that changing red and green that now for the first
time seems to me to have run through my story like a fateful burden of
jealousy and blood, I will set down such isolated reflections as rise
of themselves out of the jumble of my mind.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" >

<p><i>Crime</i> (I realise that the word leaps with some suddenness into these
pages) has suffered more at the hands of criminals than it has at the
hands of justice. There are few perfect crimes. Most of them are
accidental, the mere explosion of momentary passion. And that is well,
for the world wants few masterpieces in that sort. I have not read De
Quincey's essay on the subject, nor ever shall now; but if crime is to
be considered as an artistic medium, it is the only medium in which
bungling is better worth to the world than competence. Other arts one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
prefers to see superlatively practised or not at all; but it is only
of the bungled crime that man can endure to think.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" >

<p>The ordinary criminal begins at the wrong end. Dull fellow that he is
he does not recognise that his first task must be the creation of an
attitude of mind. Or if a glimmering of this does cross his inflamed
consciousness, he thinks that it is the attitude of his own mind that
is of the first consequence. That is why he suffers either the
retribution of justice or the visitings of his own conscience. In
either of these cases his act is unsuccessfully committed. He pays in
common with his victim.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" >

<p>It is not the injured man who knows the full quality of hate. It is
the one who injures. The injurer has no refuge from his own
transgression; he has him whom he has injured constantly upon his
mind&mdash;perhaps upon his soul. Another is the lord of his peace of mind.
Thus it is peculiarly the wronged man's part to pardon, but when the
wronged man would not pardon, but would avenge for another's sake?</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" >

<p>Could Archie be given a mind more sensitive than a stone? Could his
weak and spongy nature be hardened to a point of view? Could such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
attitude be created in him that what otherwise would have been an
assault would take on the stern justice of a punishment? Can any dull
or egotistical mind be either punished or rewarded? Ultimately, can
the God who created it do anything save quench it again? Wickedness
may be vanquished at the last, but Ignorance&mdash;&mdash;? And Conceit&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" >

<p>But bah! Probably he was not even thinking of it. Perhaps he was even
now seeking a way out. Well, I would help him. Ten words to him in
private.... Faugh!</p>

<p>So <i>that</i> was it.... And the world allows it! Could he be proved to be
merely insane at the time of his marriage the world would not allow
it; a mental insufficiency beyond his control would be a bar; but this
other, that he had deliberately sought, would be allowed. And Evie....</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" >

<p>That bloody apostrophe again!...</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" >

<p>The criminal forgets too much in the moment of action. It is a sort of
stage fright. Rehearsed perfectly, however.... Not that the thing is
not admittedly difficult. A button, a fingerprint, a drop of blood,
the resources of the laboratory, the microscope, the spectroscope&mdash;oh
yes, it cannot be said that there is not a deal to watch. And a
memory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> a chance association years afterwards, an attack of debility
rendering the eyes subject to deceits&mdash;any one of these things may at
any moment throw him into the hands of the law as a fate more merciful
than that which he has not been clever enough to forestall within
himself. Yes, there is much to consider; but then, as all the world
knows, masterpieces of crime or what not, are difficult of
accomplishment.</p>

<p>Ten words, then, on the morrow, and he would never dare....</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" >

<p>But bah! I was not even sure! He <i>could</i> not be contemplating it, and
I was vile to think it.... Still, prudence. I must make sure. Till
then, nothing&mdash;not even these thoughts that ticked as if out of a
tape-machine from my brain. To-morrow....</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" >

<p>Yet, ah! I was sure for all that!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" >

<p>This red and green, this red and green!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" >

<p>These are such fragments of it all as I can remember. I don't know how
long they occupied me. I had begun to trace with my fingers little
patterns on the deal top of my table, patterns that sometimes had a
meaning for me, sometimes not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> but that always had a meaning for
Archie Merridew if he thought ... if he as much as thought....</p>

<p>Then the red and green advertisement was switched off suddenly. Only a
rhomb of dim gaslight on my ceiling remained....</p>

<p>But I still sat in the darkness, my brain taking those backward and
forward jerks, and my lips muttering, though without sound, that if he
dreamed ... if he as much as dreamed....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p><br></p>
<h3>III</h3>

<p>It was a "record" even for myself to get the sack twice in one week,
but that now befell me. They gave me no notice at the newspaper
office, but they were decent, and I had a fortnight's wages in lieu of
it. Pettinger especially showed himself my friend.</p>

<p>"It's rough on you," he said, "but I really don't see that anybody's
to blame.... Look here, I'll tell you what we'll do. Go down to my
place at Bedford; I'll telephone them you're coming; and you can do
what there is to do in my garden for a week or two until something
turns up. You won't mind working under the old chap I've got there?
Right. Off you go. You've got your money, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"I shall have to come up for Friday evening; I've a class," I said.</p>

<p>"Well, have a change till then. You look as if you need it. Catch the
twelve-fifty, and I'll telephone them now."</p>

<p>So I took off my sky-blue uniform and wondered, as I folded it neatly
and laid it aside, where they were going to find the next man it would
fit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>This was at half-past ten in the morning, so that I had some hours to
spare. Ten minutes, if I could catch him, would suffice for all I had
to say to Archie Merridew, and, as he was not an early riser, and had
told me that he was not spending his days in bed, I hoped to find him
before he went out. But as the Business College lay on the way I
determined to call there first. I walked up Chancery Lane into
Holborn.</p>

<p>But he had not arrived at the college when I got there, and I did not
wait for him. I had walked home with him often enough to know his
unvarying route, and I set off for his place half expecting to meet
him on the way. But I did not meet him, so I knocked at the brass
knocker of his ivy-green door.</p>

<p>Jane told me he had only that moment gone out.</p>

<p>"To the college?" I asked.</p>

<p>Jane thought so, but was not sure.</p>

<p>"If I don't see him I'll call again," I said. "Tell him, will you?"</p>

<p>I returned to the Business College, and there waited, talking to
Kitty, who had just arrived.</p>

<p>Kitty seemed extremely embarrassed that morning, and of course I
guessed the reason. She had heard of the sky-blue uniform, doubtless
through Archie. (For two nights I had not seen her.) I was none the
less sure of this that she did not mention the circumstance directly;
nor did she comment on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> being at liberty at that unusual hour of
the morning. Presently she said:</p>

<p>"I don't think he'll come this morning now. He may this afternoon."</p>

<p>"I can't wait till the afternoon," I said, glancing at the little
clock on the mantelpiece of the type-writing-room&mdash;the little clock
that had given the "Ting" that had startled me so on the day of the
examination in Method.</p>

<p>"Is it anything I can tell him?"</p>

<p>That, of course, was quite out of the question. "I'll see if he's back
home yet," I replied.</p>

<p>Then Kitty's uneasiness and curiosity got the better of her delicacy
about the sky-blue uniform. She looked fixedly at her thin wrists and
her fingers gave little touches to the lace about them as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Jeff," she said timorously, "I don't know whether you know what&mdash;what
they're saying about you&mdash;I'm sure it's a hideous lie, but&mdash;but it's
upset me frightfully&mdash;&mdash;" She stopped abruptly, and seemed even then
to wish she had not spoken.</p>

<p>"You seem very easily upset nowadays," I said shortly, quite ready to
quarrel if needs be.</p>

<p>But she ignored my tone. "You know they're saying&mdash;everybody's
saying&mdash;all the people here, I mean."</p>

<p>"What?" I demanded.</p>

<p>But her courage failed her. She stopped the fiddling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> at her wrists,
and, giving me a long look said, "You know I love you, Jeff, whatever
happens&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was what I had begun to fear&mdash;that there would be no shaking her
off. She was far, far too faithful.</p>

<p>"I see," I said slowly. "I know what you mean.... Well, it was quite
true. I <i>was</i> a commissionaire&mdash;until an hour ago. They've sacked
me.... I suppose Archie told you?"</p>

<p>"Girl-faced little wretch! But, Jeff&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I took her up. "Well, it's that that I want to see him about. But as
regards you and me&mdash;if you want it to make a difference&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was a plain offer to release her, but I don't think she understood
it as that. Indeed, her manner puzzled me entirely. It was eager,
shrinking, wistful and apprehensive all at once, and she appeared to
be trying to shake off something&mdash;something preposterous. Well, that
sky-blue uniform had been preposterous enough.</p>

<p>"It shall make a difference&mdash;if you wish," I offered again proudly.</p>

<p>"No," she murmured, apparently understanding this time, and busy with
her lace again.</p>

<p>Then I entered into I know not what fantastic explanation of the
curious fact that a man with the world in his grasp should have chosen
to touch his cap to editors and proprietors. She tried to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> as if
she believed me, but it was plain that she didn't in the least. Once
or twice she tried to interrupt me, but my patience was quickly
running out.</p>

<p>"So you see how it was," I said at last, dropping my voice as Weston,
the secretary-bird passed. "It was no business of his, and I want to
know what he's got to say about it. You can tell him so if you like."</p>

<p>Again that inexplicable look of timorousness came into her small eyes.</p>

<p>"You <i>mean</i> the commissionaire's job, of course?" she said.</p>

<p>"I mean the commissionaire's job," I replied.</p>

<p>That, I thought with satisfaction, would cover my real reason for
wishing to see Archie as well as anything else.</p>

<p>Weston passed again, and gave me a look. That look struck me. It was
just such a look as a policeman might give a loiterer whom he
suspects, yet against whom he has no charge; and I felt my colour
mount a little. That tattling little animal! Little he cared, as long
as he had his joke, that my five shillings was put in jeopardy. For a
business college that styles itself advertisement writer "professor"
naturally doesn't want commissionaires on its staff, and I saw my
second dismissal looming ahead.</p>

<p>Then, with a new and cautious idea in my head, I turned to Kitty
again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>"On second thoughts," I said, "<i>don't</i> say anything to Archie about my
wanting an explanation. I'll settle with him. After all, it was bound
to come sooner or later. It doesn't much matter. I'll see to it....
Well, I'm off. Good-bye, dear. I don't think I shall be able to see
you again till Friday."</p>

<p>And I left her, nodded to Weston, and passed out.</p>

<p>I daresay you guess what my new and cautious idea was. I had something
of the last privacy to say to Archie; it was just as well that I
should have the cloak of comparatively trivial personal remonstrance
to cover it; but this was only part of it. The truth was that my brain
had suddenly taken another of those startling leaps forward. In some
conceivable last event (I was not planning one, you understand; it was
merely that my mind was working somewhere ahead, independently and
beyond my control) it might be necessary that I should have <i>no</i>
personal quarrel with him. In such an event none must suppose that our
relation had been other than amicable. Yet I should be overdoing this
(purely anticipatory) prudence to pass over the episode of the
sky-blue uniform entirely. The thing was, or might become, a matter of
nicely measured proportions. Already I was making the slight private
affront serve my turn; presently I might want to make the pardon of
that affront serve my turn also.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> This kind of thing is what I mean by
the creation of an attitude of mind and "attention to detail."</p>

<p>I made one more attempt to find Archie as I walked to St Pancras, but
he was still not at home. Then I had to run for my train.</p>

<p>I worked in Pettinger's garden that week, carrying water, wheeling
barrows, and filling baskets with fruit as I passed between the canes.
Pettinger was away for two nights, but on the third evening he came up
to me as I was pushing a heavy roller over the lawn and began to talk.
I think he began for the sake of a pleasant word or two, but something
I said seemed to engage his interest, an hour or more passed, and
then, as the phlox and canterbury bells began to glimmer in the
twilight, he suddenly said, "Leave this and come inside&mdash;we can talk
comfortably there."</p>

<p>We went in. I shall never forget that night. It was made memorable by
the fact that master and gardener talked till two o'clock in the
morning.</p>

<p>"Well, Jeffries," he said at last, with a sleepy yawn, "you're an
extraordinary chap. I'm afraid you've made rather a lot of work for me
this last hour or two."</p>

<p>"How so?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well, I was going to try to get you a job something like your last,
but you're a difficult man to find a job for. I won't ask you whether
you know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> you're extraordinary; of course you know you are; and I'm
going, if I can, to give you a chance&mdash;a real chance&mdash;not like that
other&mdash;those cut-throats&mdash;what's their name."</p>

<p>I had told him about Rixon Tebb &amp; Masters' and the rest of it.</p>

<p>"I've a bit of a pull here and there," he went on sleepily. "There's
the 'Freight and Ballast Company'&mdash;I know a couple of their men&mdash;but
we'll talk about that in the morning. I'm off to bed. Hope they've
made you comfortable?"</p>

<p>It does not come within the scope of my present tale to speak of my
later rapid rise; but I may say now that I owed my chance to Pettinger
and to the berth he got me, with the coming of winter, in the offices
of the "F. B. C."</p>

<p>I remained in his house all that week; then, on the Friday evening, I
took a return ticket to town in order to attend my class.</p>

<p>I had not been half-an-hour in the college that evening before I was
aware that something had happened. Archie Merridew was not there, but
Evie was, and so was Kitty Windus. I went through my work as usual,
and then, at half-past nine, sought Kitty. It was she who told me the
news.</p>

<p>"You've not heard, have you?" she asked, with a glance towards the
senior students' room, through which Evie had just passed. Again she
was, in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> manner I could not understand, eager, reserved,
apprehensive and fidgety all at once.</p>

<p>"Heard what?" I asked.</p>

<p>"About Evie. It's come off. She and Archie are properly engaged."</p>

<p>From that moment dated a division of me into two separate men, of
which I shall have more to say presently.</p>

<p>"Oh?" I replied, with complete calm. "That's good news indeed! Wait
here a minute&mdash;I'll speak to her&mdash;don't go, for I want to see you."</p>

<p>I met Evie returning with her towel and celluloid box of soap. She too
was excited, so excited that she would have passed me, but I thought I
understood that. I stopped her.</p>

<p>"Well, Evie?" I said, smiling.</p>

<p>She waited, painfully full, I couldn't help thinking, of emotion.</p>

<p>"It was you who congratulated me before," I said. "It's my turn now, I
hear."</p>

<p>She looked at me and away again, and again at me and away.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr Jeffries," she said, beginning to make little pointings
of her foot this way and that on the floor.</p>

<p>I spoke very gently. "Jeff&mdash;or Mr Jeffries if you prefer it&mdash;wishes
you nothing but happiness, Evie," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you," she said, with increasing perturbation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> "thank you
very much indeed&mdash;thank you really&mdash;Jeff."</p>

<p>It was odd in the extreme. She gave me the reluctant "Jeff," and
somehow I wished she hadn't, it came with such difficulty. Something,
I was convinced, lay behind it. I did not expect her in the
circumstances to be quite collected, but her manner was&mdash;I don't know
how else to describe it&mdash;almost that of a child who has pleaded with
authority for permission to bestow one final charity on an undesirable
associate.... What! I thought, she also ashamed to know a
commissionaire!</p>

<p>"When are you going to be married?" I asked, after an awkward pause.</p>

<p>"Quite soon," she replied, equally awkward. "As soon as I can get my
things ready." She stopped.</p>

<p>"I suppose Archie's coming here for you&mdash;to-night, I mean?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;he's got a man to see&mdash;a friend&mdash;in Store Street, I think."</p>

<p>"Then may I walk along with you?"</p>

<p>She seemed to have feared the question. "Oh," she said quickly, "if
you don't mind&mdash;I've something awfully private to say to Kitty&mdash;she
and I have arranged to go on together."</p>

<p>("Not wanted," I said to myself.) Aloud, "Well, I hope you'll be
happy, Evie," I added.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said again, lifting curiously appealing eyes for a
moment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>I turned abruptly from her, and sought Kitty, who was still waiting. I
had picked up a sudden suspicion, and wished to confirm it.</p>

<p>"Ready?" I said, in a tone as matter of fact as I could assume.</p>

<p>Again she began to flutter. I couldn't understand what had come over
the whole college.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Jeff," she began, with rapid effusiveness. "If I'd only
known you wanted&mdash;but I've got to go somewhere."</p>

<p>I knew that, Evie had just told me.</p>

<p>"Woburn Place, you mean?"</p>

<p>"No, dear&mdash;somewhere else&mdash;quite different."</p>

<p>"Really?" I said, incredulously smiling and frowning both at once.</p>

<p>"Of course! How funny you are!"</p>

<p>I looked searchingly down into her eyes.</p>

<p>"I think <i>you're</i> funny," I said slowly.</p>

<p>"You really must excuse me, Jeff&mdash;if you'd only let me know."</p>

<p>But I had had enough of this. Gently but irresistibly I took her arm.</p>

<p>"Come along, Kitty," I said quietly. "I particularly want to talk to
you."</p>

<p>She quailed, but still hung back.</p>

<p>"Very well," I said. "Will you tell me where you're going?"</p>

<p>She was obstinately silent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're going with Evie, of course?"</p>

<p>I knew by the little rush with which she spoke that she was telling
the truth and was relieved to be able to do so. "Oh no!" she said.
"I'm going quite alone, quite alone&mdash;honour, Jeff!"</p>

<p>"Evie's not going with you&mdash;to Store Street or wherever it is?"</p>

<p>She stiffened. "I don't know what you mean by Store Street, and I
think you've got Evie on the brain," she said.</p>

<p>What the devil ailed them all?</p>

<p>And why had Evie said she was going with Kitty?</p>

<p>As abruptly as I turned away from the one I now turned away from the
other.</p>

<p>The next moment: "Er&mdash;'Jeffries!" I Heard.</p>

<p>It was Weston with my five shillings. I turned.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jeffries! I'm sorry to say&mdash;glad in one sense of course&mdash;that
Professor Hitchcock will be taking the class again next Friday. The
college wishes&mdash;wishes to thank you for stopping the gap as you have
done. It's been most obliging of you."</p>

<p>I said something&mdash;I was glad Hitchcock was better, I said.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;er&mdash;he's quite well again now&mdash;quite on his feet again," said
the secretary-bird. "And&mdash;er&mdash;Jeffries&mdash;I'm exceedingly sorry, but
I've a rather unpleasant duty to perform."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>I was utterly mystified. "What is it now?" I demanded almost roughly.</p>

<p>"It's that the Board is of opinion&mdash;has come to the conclusion&mdash;that
consisting as we do of younger students than yourself&mdash;it would be of
advantage&mdash;perhaps of advantage to you too if&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I helped him out. "If I don't come again?"</p>

<p>"I wished to break it gently to you&mdash;but that <i>is</i> the substance of
it," he stammered.</p>

<p>Curious....</p>

<p>"Thank you, Weston," I said. "I quite understand. Will you please tell
them that I didn't ask for any explanation?"</p>

<p>Exceedingly curious....</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, yes," he murmured sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Now," I said to myself some minutes later, as I descended the stairs,
"it only requires Miss Angela to turn me down."</p>

<p>I walked to Woburn Place, and there asked a Swiss boy if I might see
Miss Angela. Archie's friend Mr Shoto passed me as I waited in the
hall, but I did not speak to him. After some minutes the Swiss boy
returned. His answer was what I expected. Miss Soames had a nervous
headache, and asked to be excused from seeing me.</p>

<p>And all, I thought with amazement as I turned away, because for a week
or two I had worn a sky-blue uniform!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p><br></p>
<h3>IV</h3>

<p>That division of me into two men that I have said dated from the time
when Kitty told me of Evie's engagement to Archie Merridew was, in a
sense, no new thing. I had felt it in some measure before, when I had
deliberately avoided Archie that I might give my anger its head and
had smiled in his face again when the fit had worked itself out. I had
striven, too, to stand between him and the black rages he and my
general circumstances had provoked.</p>

<p>But no sooner had the words, that Evie was now definitely engaged,
come from Kitty's lips than I knew this division to be complete and
irrevocable. Even did he withdraw in time he had still contemplated
it; and in my soul I did not now believe he would withdraw. "The Devil
was sick, the Devil a Saint would be." And I knew at last who his
friend in Store Street was. A name, seen on a medicine bottle in his
room, had leaped into my memory. His "friend" was some obscure
practitioner of a doctor.</p>

<p>So I now became as the Giant in the story, who was so exquisitely
cloven from head to middle by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> the magic blade that he did not feel
the wound that was his death. "Cut, then!" he laughed. "Shake
yourself," he was told. And he fell in twain.</p>

<p>A shake, and I too should fall in twain.</p>

<p>I will now tell you how I got that shake.</p>

<p>Thinking over my sudden ostracism in Pettinger's house that night I
only became more and more mystified. That the Business College should
no longer require me I could understand&mdash;for snobbery plays a terrible
part in business. That Kitty had reproached me for my lack of trust in
her about my commissionaire's post was also easily to be accounted
for. Miss Angela might in truth have had a headache and have begged to
be excused from receiving me. But that Evie should turn against me was
inexplicable. It contradicted every tradition of her upbringing. My
being forced into a humble, but not ignoble, occupation could never
have made this difference in her. If anything in the whole business
could be taken as a certainty, that could. And so the more I thought
about it the more sure I became that, though I myself might conceal my
real reason for wishing to see Archie Merridew by giving out that I
merely wanted to remonstrate with him about his chattering, others
were using that very giving-out as a screen for something I was in
total ignorance of. Kitty's timorousness returned to me; I believed
now that she had actually been trying to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> tell me something else,
whatever it was; and so I tossed and turned on my pillow, vainly
racking my brain.</p>

<p>I finally decided to have it out with both Kitty and Archie on the
morrow.</p>

<p>I went up to town the next morning, and walked straight to the
Business College. I did not wish, after what I had been told the night
before, to go up, so I found an office boy on one of the lower floors
and sent him up with word that somebody would like to see Miss Windus.
Then I waited, just inside the Holburn entrance.</p>

<p>In a few minutes she came down, hatted and gloved. Her face looked
old; her eyes were dull, and almost closed&mdash;with weeping, I was
instantly sure; and she touched my sleeve almost as if she feared I
might shake her hand off again.</p>

<p>"I thought it would be you," she said, in a dull voice. "Let's have a
walk. I've something to say."</p>

<p>We walked without speaking along Holborn, and presently turned into
the little courtyard of Staple's Inn. We sat down on the bench that
surrounds the tree in the middle.</p>

<p>She had broken into speech almost before we sat down. It was as if she
feared that if she did not get it out at once she would not speak at
all. She was intensely agitated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jeff," she said, "I've wronged you&mdash;cruelly and basely."</p>

<p>I did not smile at the melodramatic little phrase. I had not the ghost
of an idea what she meant, but that something was impending I was
already aware.</p>

<p>"I saw you didn't know last night," she went on. "This morning?"</p>

<p>It was a question. "I'm no wiser this morning," I said.</p>

<p>"You asked me where I was going last night."</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Can you guess why when&mdash;when I tell you it was to Louie Causton's?"</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>"Even then I cannot guess."</p>

<p>Then she began to tremble. She grasped the edge of the seat with her
hand so that I should not see how she shook.</p>

<p>"Jeff," she said, in a low voice, "if you never want to see me
again&mdash;I can't blame you if you don't&mdash;not after this."</p>

<p>I waited.</p>

<p>"Not that I shouldn't always, always love you. It will be my
punishment&mdash;I shall have to bear it."</p>

<p>Still I waited.</p>

<p>"Yesterday it was you who offered it&mdash;now it's me&mdash;it will serve me
right."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>I thought she would never go on. "You mean our engagement, of course?"
I said.</p>

<p>"Yes," she gulped.</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;because of what I've been beast enough to believe of you,
Jeff."</p>

<p>"And that is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>As I again waited for her to speak I looked round the courtyard. A
clerk was at work in a first-floor window, and he caught my eye and
looked away again. In another window an office boy stood with a pen in
his mouth, turning the pages of a ledger. Then, after a while, and
very disjointedly, Kitty went on:</p>

<p>"They said you said it yourself, and I&mdash;at first I didn't&mdash;but then I
believed it. I know I was beastly about it once before&mdash;then we
quarrelled&mdash;but I didn't mean what I said then&mdash;believe me, I
didn't.... And," she went on, "I didn't know who&mdash;who&mdash;it was.... She
never told me&mdash;you know what I mean.... I hate myself&mdash;now. I suppose
I'm jealous&mdash;the green-eyed monster, Jeff&mdash;but they did say it&mdash;said
you'd as much as said so yourself&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I was beginning to get impatient with her rambling.</p>

<p>I said "And what?" but I don't think she heard me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>"So that's why I went to Louie herself&mdash;to ask her&mdash;right out&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>All at once I felt it coming.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>But suddenly she buried her face in her hands, and her thin shoulders
shook. Again I saw the clerk watching....</p>

<p>"Oh!" she moaned. "Can you ever, <i>ever</i> forgive me?"</p>

<p>"For&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For ever thinking that you and Louie&mdash;that you and Louie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She lifted her piteous eyes to mine.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" >

<p>I think it was then that the Giant shook himself and fell in twain. He
has been more or less roughly cobbled together since, and the halves
rub on somehow side by side, but to this day the one man in me faints
for the great sweet things of Life, while the other has the devil ever
at his elbow.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" >

<p>The whole courtyard had swung round; I actually seemed, with my
physical eye, to see it for some moments out of the vertical. Then it
righted again, and the whole mystery of the previous evening dissolved
in light.</p>

<p>"You and Louie&mdash;you and Louie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Yet again the courtyard seemed to lean and slide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span> sideways for a
moment; then I flung a blazing searchlight back across my memory.</p>

<p>Louie Causton's super-subtle mask. "So long since I saw a man, my
dear&mdash;the Baboon?&mdash;oh, I should know which way to turn <i>then</i>!"</p>

<p>My half-admissions to Archie when he had tried with such persistency
to get out of me who it was I was in love with.</p>

<p>Her failure to return to the college, that alone had thrown me into
Kitty's arms rather than into her own.</p>

<p>That something, God knows what, that I might have said to Mackie when,
after having eaten nothing, I had drunk with him.</p>

<p>Kitty's own desperate possessiveness and jealousy.</p>

<p>All these things fell into place as the coloured granules fall when
the kaleidoscope is given a turn. I had been accused of being Miss
Causton's lover!</p>

<p>As I remain that divided Giant henceforward until the end of my tale,
I will divide my name also, and tell you of a colloquy that began
within me between these two men&mdash;the honest, human, enraged Jeffries,
and that other, whom I will call James Herbert, at whose elbow stood
the devil.</p>

<p>"Ah!" choked Jeffries, flaming red.</p>

<p>"Quietly, quietly!" whispered his interlocutor.</p>

<p>"That's Merridew again!" choked the other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>"Quietly&mdash;keep your face&mdash;there's a clerk in that window watching
you!"</p>

<p>"The whole world may see me&mdash;let me go and find him!" It was as if
this Jeffries struggled to break away there and then.</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;sit still&mdash;leave it to me, and keep your face before this
weeping woman&mdash;<i>I</i> was born where they understand these things!"</p>

<p>And after a hellish minute&mdash;the voice of that one prevailed.</p>

<p>I turned to Kitty.</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" I remember I said, with an air almost of amused
incredulity. "Why, who on earth told you that ridiculous tale?"</p>

<p>The one who came from the place where they understand these things was
right. Kitty looked up. At first she seemed unable to believe her
ears&mdash;unable to believe that I could treat the monstrous thing with
amused disdain. Then, as she slowly realised, her face shone. She gave
a quick glad cry.</p>

<p>"Jeff!"</p>

<p>"What, dear?" I said, smiling.</p>

<p>She choked. "Oh ... my good, big man!"</p>

<p>("Laugh now," the wicked one prompted; and I laughed.)</p>

<p>"Good heavens, what a tale!... Who told you? Archie? Just you see if I
don't tweak that young man's ears!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>In her infinite relief the poor woman broke down utterly. She shook
with the mingled gratitude and humiliation of my pardon.</p>

<p>"Louie Causton!" I scoffed. "You actually asked her that? Why, how she
must have laughed!"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;you're wonderful, Jeff!" Kitty adored me.</p>

<p>"Oh," I replied, quickly recollecting myself, "don't think I'm not
angry! I'll give that young man a jacket-dusting! He shall have a
wedding present from me he'll remember, I promise you! Why, of all the
mean tricks!..."</p>

<p>I went on. Presently Kitty had found me so wonderful that once more
she could even toy a little with a peril.</p>

<p>"Louie wouldn't tell me ... who ... she said she'd die first...." she
half sobbed by-and-by.</p>

<p>I looked into her little puffed eyes. "Then," I said, smiling, "you've
only the word of a not very trustworthy woman for it that after all
... eh?"</p>

<p>A saint could hardly have cheapened the worshipping look she gave me.</p>

<p>"So," I resumed presently, "that was what ailed you all last night,
when I was thinking all the time it was my uniform?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I tried hard to tell you, Jeff&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And does Archie really believe this tale himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> or is it just one
of his little pleasantries?"</p>

<p>She didn't know.</p>

<p>"Is he at the college this morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Good. Will you send him down to me if I walk back with you? I think
we won't lose any time over this."</p>

<p>"And you'll give him a really severe talking-to?" she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"I will," I promised. "Come&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later I was again in the doorway of the Business
College, waiting for Archie to descend.</p>

<p>And as I waited I reflected how well-nigh irrevocably I had tied
myself up with Kitty now. I think that up to then she would have stuck
to me even had this of Miss Causton been true; but now she would
never, never let me go. Perhaps I may here mention the plan I had at
first had for getting rid of her when I should require her no longer.
I had based that plan on the fascination the "compromising situation"
of her favourite novels always had for her. I never knew anyone so
self-conscious about her defencelessness, and I had worked it out that
I had only to propose my own chamber for an assignation and she would
conceive herself to be looking into the bright face of danger indeed.
All peril and all romance would lie for her in her setting foot on
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> lowest of my stairs.... And doubtless one glance at that naked
room of mine (I had pawned even my oil-stove) would, I had estimated,
drive her away in instant and horrified fright.... I had not been
above planning this.</p>

<p>But now she would never, never leave her big, wonderful man.</p>

<p>Yes. I had fettered myself fairly completely.</p>

<p>Holborn was noisy that morning, and between the sound of passing
vehicles and Archie's own light tread I was not aware of his presence
until he spoke. Instantly I saw that he thought he knew why I had come
and had resolved to take one bull at least by the horns.</p>

<p>"I say, Jeff," he began at once, with embarrassed sincerity&mdash;a sincere
desire, that is, to be out of the mess he had landed himself in,
"Kitty's just told me. I know&mdash;I know you must be beastly angry with
me&mdash;quite right too&mdash;I'm awfully sorry and&mdash;and ashamed. It was
caddish. But I really didn't mean anything, and&mdash;and&mdash;and I thought
you as much as said it yourself, you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I judged it best not to speak just yet. I stood looking at him.</p>

<p>"You're an awfully good sort," he went on, conciliatingly,
"but&mdash;but&mdash;I really thought you <i>were</i> a bit sweet on her (that was
all I meant)&mdash;that time&mdash;you know&mdash;before I knew it was really Kitty.
I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> simply said to Mackie&mdash;he watched you too at the party&mdash;I admit I
was 'on' a bit, and never thought it would end like this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then I spoke. "You mean you didn't think it would end in my getting
the sack and being cut by everybody I know except yourself and Mackie?
How did you think it would end, then?"</p>

<p>He jumped eagerly at a chance, ready to promise anything.</p>

<p>"I'll see that's all right, old boy&mdash;and Hitchcock <i>was</i> coming back
anyway, you know&mdash;you only had the job while he was away&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!" I said, with a nasty laugh. "And in your opinion that's all?...
What about my character?" I demanded suddenly. "Eh?"</p>

<p>"I know," he said, with hanging head. "It was rotten of me&mdash;but I was
'on'&mdash;I really was. And your character's all right, Jeff, with anybody
who knows you&mdash;they know what a first-rate sort you are&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you," I said stiffly. "And what about&mdash;the partner in my
guilt?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>her</i>!" the little animal said, as if <i>she</i> could be left quite
out of the question. Then apparently he felt the stirring of returning
rectitude. "Well, Jeff, I have apologised.... I don't see what more I
can do, except of course to see you all right...."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>I noted the birth of the attitude I wished to create. I began to
appear to let him down by gradual degrees.</p>

<p>Exactly how much of it was appearance you see. I abhorred the little
wretch. And his renewed apologies, promises, explanations!... He had
been "on" he had "simply said" to Mackie; I "should have lost my job
soon in any case"; and "he'd see I was all right!" ... That was all
his sense of a hideous slander! And his almost rebellious "Well, I
have apologised." Good heavens, he would be putting <i>me</i> in the wrong
presently!... Every muscle in my body was straining to be at him.</p>

<p>But that, I knew, would never, never do.</p>

<p>Presently I turned once more to him. All this, after all, was not in
the least what I had come to talk to him about. It was only a screen.</p>

<p>"Very, well," I said at last. "What's done's done. We'll leave that
for the present. Now there's something else I want to say to you. Do
you know what it is?"</p>

<p>"How should I know?" he said, relieved that the subject was turned.</p>

<p>"Think...."</p>

<p>When Kitty had come down to see me an hour before she had done so in
her hat and coat. She had had her confession to make, and had, I
fancied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> done me even in her attire the courtesy of hinting humbly
that she was entirely at my disposal. But Archie evidently thought
that our difference could be arranged in a five minutes' talk
sandwiched in between two lessons. He had not even put his hat on. He
stood, a small fair figure, red-waistcoated, brass-buttoned, hands in
his pockets, leaning against the name-board of the tenants of the
various floors of the building, while I, with one hand against the
board, hung over him like a huge angel of good and evil, bidding him
think.</p>

<p>"Think," I said again.</p>

<p>He suddenly realised what I meant. I could no more hold his eyes than
I could have held those of a chidden dog. They cringed, evaded, even
dared short defiances.</p>

<p>"Think," I said once more.</p>

<p>All at once he said, "I don't know what you mean."</p>

<p>"Then," I said, "I shall have to tell you."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" >

<p>"So," I concluded some minutes later, "do you think you are&mdash;doing
right&mdash;to marry?"</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" >

<p>We still stood, he with his back to the name-board, I with my hand
against it, almost enveloping him with my physical presence. And now,
no detail of my arraignment spared, I had at last caught his eye.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
Even before he spoke my heart gave a savage leap. Already his soft and
spongy nature had begun to be hardened to that attitude I needed.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he said.... Then, proudly, "But this is interference."</p>

<p>"You think," I repeated slowly, "that you have the right to get
married?"</p>

<p>His very admission was a defiance of me. "I know I've been rather a
rotter," he blustered.</p>

<p>Once more I repeated monotonously:</p>

<p>"You still think, after what I've just said, that you have the
right&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think," he broke out, "that if you looked after your own girl and
left me to look after mine it would be better. I'm frightfully sorry
about the other thing, of course, but&mdash;dash it all!&mdash;--"</p>

<p>Our long exchange of looks said the rest, and it was not my fault if
he didn't understand what his refusal to heed me would involve. Some
people never understand, and cry afterwards, "You never told me that!"
as if one man had the right to demand of another that he should speak
the uttermost word. I cannot see that there is any such right. For
such as these there is no uttermost word. Elias and the Prophets
cannot make them understand. Though one rose from the dead to tell
them they would not believe. The God who made them as they are cannot
make Himself known to them&mdash;He can only destroy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> them again. They go
out into the night in their ignorance, and for them there is no
resurrection in knowledge.... Therefore if the uttermost word will not
enlighten them, why speak it? Weakness lies in that word. Because it
is weak. Art leaves it unspoken, and the Seer, having spoken it, comes
down from Sinai no more. Only by a withholding from it does man
achieve. Making three parts greater than the whole, he does not put
forth to the last. He will not return bankrupt to heaven. The
unuttered utterance is his credential, to be restored to the Bestower
of it.</p>

<p>Therefore I did not, at that time, tell Archie Merridew that if he
married I should slay him. But all, all else was in my eyes for his
taking.</p>

<p>Then our gaze severed.</p>

<p>As I dropped my hand from the wall the devil frisked in me again. I
had warned him, and had my own safety to consider now. Without
attention to detail you can accomplish nothing in this world, and a
thing is bunglingly done when you yourself suffer the consequences of
it. Whatever I might do, I intended to suffer no consequences.</p>

<p>"Well, Archie," I said, as a man speaks who washes his hands of
something, "I've told you what I think about it. There's no doubt it
is, as you say, an interference, but I think it's justified, and so
I'll say no more.... And now, about that other:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> I need hardly say
that I expect you to make things all right for me again."</p>

<p>"I will&mdash;I really will, Jeff," he promised at once.</p>

<p>"You see," I amplified, while the devil in me frisked, "leaving my
reputation out of the question, it's beastly inconvenient. For
instance, I'm badly in need of some shorthand practice, and I
certainly don't intend to go up these stairs again until I'm
rehabilitated."</p>

<p>He leaped at the chance of a reparation that would cost him little.
"Oh, that's easy," he said. "Of course your own place&mdash;I mean, why not
use mine, as you used to?"</p>

<p>"Oh," I objected, "I can't very well use your place when you're not
there."</p>

<p>"I'm going to be there most of the time now," he replied. "Perhaps you
think I'm off on the skite again, but I'm not." ("The Devil was sick,"
thought I again.) "I'm dead off all that now&mdash;straight. I do wish
you'd come!"</p>

<p>"But," I said (while that imp in me positively capered), "you'll be
awfully busy&mdash;with other things. I hear you're to be married at
once&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not too busy for that, old man," he assured me. "Do come!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll see," I promised.</p>

<p>Half-an-hour later I was sitting in the British Museum reading-room
with a stock of books on Medical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> Jurisprudence before me. Those two
spirits within me were whispering again&mdash;plotting, machinating,
discussing common ground of action. I had not yet resolved to take any
action; but I had resolved, and firmly, that if action was to be taken
I myself was not going to be caught unawares.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>It was true that Archie was busy. His "skite" had cost him a good deal
of money, and he intended to make good some of the loss by economising
on his marriage. With this end in view he had determined that his
honeymoon and his summer holiday should be run into one, and had
fixed, or Evie had fixed for him, a day towards the end of August for
his wedding. He was going to Jersey, for the sake of the breath of the
sea (I fancy that in this he was following Store Street advice); and
he intended on his return to go into rooms until he should have had
time to look round for a house.</p>

<p>His personal preparations were extensive. Ten porters and carmen a day
called at the house near the Foundling Hospital, delivering purchases,
and his upper floor was heaped up with bags, boxes, drawers taken from
their cases and laid upon the floor, brown paper, cardboard boxes, new
clothing. And one day&mdash;I won't set down the date&mdash;he lost his latchkey
in the muddle. He did not know that he lost it as a result of my own
close studies in the reading-room of the British Museum.</p>

<p>"Can't find the blessed thing anywhere!" he grumbled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span> "I took it off
the bunch to slip into the pocket of my evening waistcoat&mdash;you can't
carry a bunch of keys about in your evening clothes&mdash;and I can't think
where the devil I put it!... Well, I shall have to ask Jane for
another."</p>

<p>It was also a consequence of my deeply private studies that about the
same time I had an accident with the hook of his bedroom door. The
night being sultry, I had removed my coat, and hung it on his hook,
over one of his, and, somehow, in going through the pockets of the
undermost coat in search of the key, he had several times twisted the
collar-tab by which my own garment hung. In taking my coat down again
a little later I used some force; I used so much force that I fetched
the whole hook down, leaving a small piece out of the wood of the
door, and, Archie, busy emptying a drawer, remarked that to put it up
again would be something for the next tenant to do.</p>

<p>"Oh no&mdash;better leave the place as you found it," I said. "You go
on&mdash;I'll attend to it."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know where you're going to find the screw-drivers&mdash;with
my latchkey, I suppose," he remarked.</p>

<p>But I knew where the screw-driver was. I found it, and put the hook up
securely again, a couple of inches below its old place.</p>

<p>I also carried constantly in my pocket, ready for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span> use at any moment,
a written page of notepaper, the compilation of which had cost me a
good deal of thought in the reading-room.</p>

<p>Yet I must make perfectly clear to you that these and twenty other
things that had the appearance of preparations committed me to
nothing. They were merely part of the prudent course of making ready,
not for the best that might happen, but for the worst; and that the
worst might be avoided I plotted at the same time with almost
extravagant care. For all this last, however, the effective human mind
works as it were in separate compartments of the job to be done, and
there was no denying that this was or might become a job. I treated it
as a job. And as a job it cost me no more qualms and tremors than the
cool preparation for an examination in Method might have done. I did
not turn pale when I read in a book of forensic medicine that when one
man slays another he commonly uses far too much violence; I merely
noted the fact, and reminded myself of it from time to time, to be
perfect in my (I still hoped superfluous) lesson. I did not blench
when I learned that, judicial executions apart, ninety-nine per cent.
of hangings were suicidal, so that, certain other precautions being
observed, a presumption could be made preponderatingly probable. I
merely turned my attention to the qualifying precautions. And as for
that sheet of paper I carried&mdash;well, young men have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> killed themselves
for less reason, and seldom for greater. Indeed, to die by his own
hand might be the final virtuous act in which he took his farewell of
the world. I would&mdash;still in the last event, you understand&mdash;allow him
that empty semblance of virtue. Whether he needed it in heaven or not,
I needed it on earth.</p>

<p>And (I am still talking purely hypothetically) I now recognise that I
had prepared our respective mental attitudes with instinctive skill.
That clever fiend within me had seen to that before I had become awake
to that fiend's existence. By about the&mdash;till say a fortnight before
the day fixed for his wedding&mdash;none could have told that I had the
shadow of a grudge against him. He had made, for his slander of
myself, a sort of semi-public apology&mdash;that is to say, he had mumbled
a few words in the presence of Weston and the Principal of the
College; but by that time the question of slander had been already so
far from me that I had hardly had to affect an equanimity of manner.
Without any effort whatever I had hit the necessary degree of
magnanimity to a nicety, and there had been an end of that. I was free
to return to the college again. This now mattered little since we were
within a few days of the end of the summer term, and it was proposed
to have, not a breaking-up party on the premises, but a boating-picnic
at Richmond.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span></p>

<p>That I was in love with Evie Soames none knew. Did they? Could they?
She was engaged to Archie, I to Kitty Windus; but I examined it again,
to make sure.... No, no suspicion of jealousy could attach to me; none
would think of a <i>crime passionel</i>.... And was it jealousy? Was it a
<i>crime passionel</i>? I do not think you can say it was. True, I intended
in the teeth of all the world to marry Evie Soames, just as I intended
one day to be rich and to make my inherent power felt; but there would
have been other ways than murder of accomplishing that. I should have
found a way.... No; he had the best reason in the world for what I was
so carefully planning for him. To me none whatever could be
attributed. My preparations (for the worst, of course) would be
complete when I had made use of that paper I carried in my pocket.</p>

<p>It was one evening less than a week before the day of his wedding that
I chose for the completion of these preparations, and I had walked
with him as far as his home. There, with a good-night, I was artfully
passing on when he himself detained me.</p>

<p>"Aren't you coming up for a bit?" he said. He had been monstrously
hospitable since I had taken him to task about the slander. I had
reckoned on this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," I replied, "I must get some shorthand practice&mdash;I'm off home."</p>

<p>"Oh, come in," he urged, taking my arm. "I sha'n't get much either
this few weeks&mdash;come in, and we'll have an hour together at speed.
Come on&mdash;I've got some books you may as well have&mdash;I sha'n't want two
sets."</p>

<p>He meant he wouldn't want Evie's text-books as well as his own. I had
not been able to afford books for my studies, and so had had to make
use of those belonging to the college. This was the nearest he had
come since my accusation to speaking about Evie and himself together.</p>

<p>I went up to his rooms for a speed practice in Pitman's Shorthand.</p>

<p>"Here are the books," he said, when he got in. "Better put 'em where
you'll have your hand on 'em&mdash;once you lose sight of a thing in this
mess you can say good-bye to it. That blessed latchkey of mine hasn't
turned up yet. Well, shall we get work over first and then talk a
bit?"</p>

<p>He swept aside with his arm a heap of new shirts and collars and
tissue-paper, took a writing-pad from the drawer of his table, and
then looked round for something from which to read aloud. I produced
from my pocket a newspaper, which I tossed over to him. I also had
cleared a portion of the table for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> myself and was sharpening a
pencil. My pad lay before me. He was taking his watch from the guard.</p>

<p>"Do I read first?" he asked, opening the newspaper. "Right-oh. Say
when you're ready."</p>

<p>I drew up my chair. "Right," I said.</p>

<p>And in his rapid, clear, high-pitched voice he began to read.</p>

<p>It was the speech of some politician or other he read, and my pencil
flew over the paper, swiftly taking down. Page after page I wrote, and
I had almost forgotten that I was engaged on anything more than an
ordinary exercise when suddenly he called "Time!" I stopped, and took
a long breath.</p>

<p>"Now transcribe," he said. "You'll find paper under those gloves."</p>

<p>"No," I said. "You take down now. Saves time. Transcribing's the slow
part, and we can both be doing that together."</p>

<p>"All right," he said, passing over the paper and making ready.</p>

<p>"Right? Go," I said.</p>

<p>And I began in my turn to read.</p>

<p>He had given me a continuous speech, but I gave him the Police Column.
"Big Blaze in Bermondsey: Suspected Arson," I gave him. ("That chap'll
get a couple of years for that," he interdicted). And then I passed to
"Alleged Bucket-shop Frauds." I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> had already got my paper from my
breast-pocket, that paper I had compiled in the reading-room of the
British Museum....</p>

<p>"&mdash;bail being granted in two sums of £500," I concluded the
bucket-shop paragraph and went on without pause:&mdash;</p>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Pathetic Confession</span>"</p>

<blockquote><p>"At Marlborough Street yesterday Rose Baxter, 24, seamstress,
living in Osnaburgh Street, was charged before Mr Siddeley
with a determined attempt to commit suicide by hanging herself
in a shed adjoining her dwelling, the property of Messrs
Wright, Knapton &amp; Co. The beginning of the case was reported
in <i>The Argus</i> of 24th June. Inspector Woodhead read aloud a
letter purporting to be in the prisoner's handwriting, from
which we take the following."</p></blockquote>

<p>("Cheerful subjects you choose, I must say," commented Archie, <i>sotto
voce</i>.)</p>

<blockquote><p>"'Dearest mother, I cannot face the disgrace. I hope you will
forgive me for the trouble I am bringing on you. I have put it
off as long as possible, hoping things would get better, but
there is only one end to it."</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>("Kid, eh?" murmured Archie, writing.)</p>

<blockquote><p>"'I trust God will forgive me. I am not afraid to die, I am
afraid to live and face it. I cannot do E. this wrong. Please,
dear mother, think of me as I used to be. I have tried and
tried, but it is all no good, and I am better out of the
world. Give my love to everybody, and try, dear mother, to
forgive me.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>"Time!"</p>

<p>Archie leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p>"Phew! Was that five minutes? Seemed short," he said. "Just a breather
before we transcribe." He lighted a cigarette. "I say, Jeff: do you
know any dealer who gives a decent price for second-hand clothes? I've
heaps here I sha'n't want any more."</p>

<p>I had small use for such a dealer. "You might try Lamb's Conduit
Street," I said. "I've bought clothes there."</p>

<p>"Silly ass&mdash;&mdash; I didn't mean that!" He was now monstrously careful of
my feelings.</p>

<p>"Say when you're ready to transcribe," I said, pushing across a wad of
paper.</p>

<p>"All right, let's get it over. I'll race you! Ready?"</p>

<p>We plunged into our longhand transcription.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah!" I said, twenty minutes later. "Beat you, Archie!"</p>

<p>He was racing through his last paragraph. "Not by much, you haven't,"
he said, and then, following our practice with exercises at the
college, "No you haven't&mdash;you haven't signed&mdash;hooray!" he cried,
dashing in his signature and looking at his watch. "Thirty-two
minutes&mdash;pretty smart, what?"</p>

<p>An hour later I left, with his exercise as well as my own slipped
between the leaves of Smillie's "Balance of Trade"&mdash;one of the
text-books he had given me.</p>

<p>My hypothetical case was now completely prepared.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" >

<p>And now I spared no effort to save him. When it is yours to slay or to
spare, you have in a sense slain even in sparing, for a life has been
yours, even as Archie Merridew's life lay in the folds of that signed
sheet of paper.</p>

<p>I carried that signed paper in my breast pocket on the day of the
breaking-up party to Richmond. It had not been my intention to go to
this picnic, for the sufficient reason that I was penniless <i>pas le
sou</i>&mdash;but once more Kitty, to whom I had told some tale or other about
pressing work, had broken out upon me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh yes&mdash;of course&mdash;I might have known!" she had cried, doubtless
knowing that "pressure of work" tale of old from Frank and Alf. "Oh
yes&mdash;it was quite enough that I should set my heart on it and I might
have known you'd be busy or something! Busy!"</p>

<p>Her scornful little laugh had set me tingling: I&mdash;busy! But I had
already seen that I should have to go. It had only remained for me to
climb down to the level of Frank and Alf in the easiest possible way.</p>

<p>"Don't carry on like that, Kitty," I had said shortly. "It isn't so
much the work; the fact is I'd like to go; but I can't very well ask
them to pay me for the work before it's done, and the fact is I've
rather miscalculated this week. It will be all right next week, of
course."</p>

<p>"Oh, if that's it," she had said, her hand going as naturally to her
pocket as if she had inherited the gesture as she had inherited her
features or her name.</p>

<p>So I had accepted her purse, having accepted only meals before, and
Alf and Frank and I were of a marrow.</p>

<p>The paper was in my breast pocket as we walked down to the stages to
hire our boats. We were a largish party, but except for those in the
boat in which I presently found myself&mdash;Evie, Kitty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span> Archie
Merridew&mdash;I have no very clear recollection of who was there. I took
one oar, Evie the other, Archie was not exercising himself physically;
and he lay back in the steering seat with Kitty. It was hot; I should
have liked to remove my coat; but I dreaded to part myself even by a
yard from that paper. As it was my movements caused it to work up a
little in my inside pocket; I saw a corner of it at the opening of the
coat; it had the appearance of wishing to take a peep at Archie; and
by-and-by Archie asked me why I didn't take my coat off.</p>

<p>"Not clean shirt day, eh, Jeff?" he laughed, with the recollection of
numerous brown-paper parcels in his eyes.</p>

<p>He himself was taking extreme care of a pair of spotless flannels, and
at one stage of the afternoon, I forget when, that suddenly struck me
as almost funny enough to shriek aloud at&mdash;his care for his flannel
bags and carelessness about everything else. It struck me as&mdash;I use
the words quite literally&mdash;devilishly funny. It fascinated me, so that
I could not keep from watching him. My eyes wandered from time to time
to the other boats of our party and of other parties, moving on the
shining river, but they always returned in less than a minute to him,
irresistibly drawn. This <i>galgenhumor</i> almost mastered me as the paper
again crept up to take another peep at him as he lolled, this time
with Evie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> by his side, for Kitty had taken the other oar. It needed
so little, so little imagination to look forward and see, strung out
into the future, the results of that irrefutable Evidence in my
pocket&mdash;the inquest at which I should not even be called as a
witness&mdash;the funeral I need attend only as a mourner&mdash;the shock&mdash;the
hushing up&mdash;and the certainty of everybody that they knew all about
it! It was all horribly, horribly perfect....</p>

<p>A picnic? Oh yes, this was a picnic....</p>

<p>"<i>Do</i> take your coat off, Jeff&mdash;you'll be so much more
comfortable&mdash;why, you're streaming!" This came from Kitty, who had the
air of publicly possessing me, though only partly by reason of having
paid for me, I think.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm quite all right&mdash;really quite comfortable," I replied.</p>

<p>And then I thought of Evie, and that horrible humour rolled away from
me. Evie. What about her? She spoke even then.</p>

<p>"Jeff's doing <i>all</i> the work," she said. "I'm sure Kitty and I could
manage the boat quite well."</p>

<p>"Better stay as we are," I replied. "Archie and I wouldn't trim."</p>

<p>Yes, what about Evie?</p>

<p>Well, for her it was only a choice of sacrifices. The choice was not
of my determining; I put that responsibility on him. There was still
time; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> would save him if I could; that was settled; but further than
that I would not go. Should she fail to survive the shock it would be
he, not I who had killed her. Better that, however....</p>

<p>If you can see what else I could have done, tell me. I am willing to
learn.</p>

<p>And so we went up the river, and drew in under a bank for tea, and
then went ashore for a walk, I with Kitty, he with Evie, and so back
to the boat again. I do not remember quite how the time went. I know
that the sun went down in a flush of rose, and that Japanese lanterns
appeared on the water and in the water in long smooth reflections, and
that parties were singing and playing banjos in the twilight. I could
not have sat by Evie&mdash;it really would have put the boat out of
trim&mdash;and so I had not to sit by Kitty either. She and I pulled again;
Archie and Evie in the stern seat were hardly distinguishable; and
Archie, who had been singing, was quiet again.</p>

<p>And I must have succeeded in keeping that dreadful mirth of mine to
myself, for Kitty had noticed nothing. She stood by my side in the
crowded station afterwards, murmuring to me how lovely it had been.</p>

<p>That is all I remember about that picnic.</p>

<p>Nor have I any reason for not telling you the truth about this. I am
concealing neither the man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> nor the devil in me. For many years I have
been almost entirely untroubled by it all, and I make even this slight
qualification only because during the last month I have had feelings,
not of remorse, but of something that is better described as a sort of
backward curiosity. Perhaps it is a little more even than that, for a
certain measure of admiration is not entirely absent from it. Don't
misunderstand me, however. That tincture of admiration is not so
strong that I cannot rest unless somebody admires my cleverness with
me. Nothing irresistibly urges me to give myself away. But I have felt
a little that backward pull of a man's own acts. I do not know, though
practically it has not come near me, why men revisit places. I do not
revisit that house near the Foundling Hospital&mdash;yet I do write this
shorthand carefully locking my door before I begin and committing it
to the most private recess of my cabinet as I complete each
instalment.... Yet other compunction, if this be compunction, have I
none. I am rich, I am serving my age by a more arduous grappling with
its economic problems than any of my contemporaries, I could have had
Pepper's knighthood had I wished for it, and I have been married this
long time to Evie Soames.... No, on the whole I do not believe in
melodramatic retributions. No shadowy shape of a fair-haired and
red-waistcoated figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> glides at my elbow or steps with me into my
brougham, and when I close my eyes at night I do not see as on a
painted curtain that dimity-papered, lamp-lighted upper chamber of
his. I do not start at sudden sounds, nor fear to be left alone in my
library when it grows late. I play with my clean-born children. Evie
is happy with me. And I even have Miss Angela in a cleft stick&mdash;for,
when things go well, she is my gentle and much-loved maiden aunt by
marriage, but when they go across she is my mother-in-law, who would
stare incredulously at any who might hint that my brain could plot a
horror and my two hands execute it.</p>

<p>And yet I write this, and sometimes waste an hour in wondering why,
all of a sudden, Kitty Windus threw me over without giving a reason,
and, when I went for one, had left her rooms in Percy Street and gone
goodness knows where.</p>

<p>But bah! They are wrong who say that for every crime somebody has to
pay. They speak from hearsay. I do not speak from hearsay. To my own
knowledge one crime has been committed for which nobody has paid and
nobody ever will.</p>

<p>Well, things are as they are ... and so I will make an end.</p>

<p>My desperate struggles to save Archie Merridew included an interview
that I had positively to force from Miss Angela. I had to force it for
the reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> that, though I was now theoretically exculpated from the
charge under which I had lain, slander always sticks, and some of it
still stuck with Miss Soames in spite of her efforts to forget it.
That, I think, was the reason why she saw me in the dining-room at
Woburn Place instead of in her own sitting-room, where, I knew, Evie
was. There, among the empty chairs, toying with Mr. Shoto's
napkin-ring and putting it down again as I remembered whose it was,
and then unconsciously taking it up again, I told her in such terms as
I could find how matters stood. She nodded from time to time.</p>

<p>Again it was not my fault if she failed to understand. She did, I now
know, fail, and failed the more hopelessly that she thought she did
understand. Many, many thick wrappings lie between placid Aunt Angela
and the stark realities of Life.</p>

<p>"I see perfectly," she said, when I had made that statement that would
have appalled any but herself. "It was exactly the same with George.
(I was once&mdash;engaged&mdash;to a man called George.) George put a precisely
similar case quite plainly before me. <i>He</i> was consumptive, or rather
his poor father was, and they do say it skips a generation&mdash;poor
George!"</p>

<p>I shook my head, but she only sighed with gentle content. She did not
really miss George.</p>

<p>"But," she went on, while my eyes wandered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> the corner by the
sideboard where Archie had had his conversation with Mr Shoto about
the Yoshiwara, "I shouldn't have refused him for that. (I did refuse
him, and I heard afterwards that for weeks he ate scarcely anything at
all.) It was something quite different that came between us&mdash;I've
never told even Evie what the real reason was."</p>

<p>I interrupted her. "Are you sure, Miss Soames, that you've quite
understood my real reason?" (More plainly I dared not speak, lest
later there should be a chink in my own armour.)</p>

<p>"Oh yes!" she purred lightly. "Old woman as I am, I <i>quite</i>
understand! As you say ... 'the children.' ..." Then, forgetting her
attitude for a moment, she became playfully roguish. "Of course, it
isn't as if you weren't in love with Miss Windus, and so in a sense
feel it more nearly. You know how <i>you</i> would feel about it. I only
say this that you may see that I <i>quite</i> understand these things do
make a difference&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"But when I solemnly assure you that that has nothing whatever to do
with it."</p>

<p>She adjusted the Indian shawl coquettishly about her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Ah, that's what you think! Come, Mr Jeffries you're positively
ungallant! As if I was so old that I'd forgotten! And not only George
either! I hope you won't be offended, Mr Jeffries, if I tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> you that
I suspect&mdash;I suspect&mdash;that in this I know you better than you know
yourself!"</p>

<p>Against that phrase there is no argument. Some people do not and
cannot see. And again I did not think Miss Angela had the right to
extract from me the uttermost word. I was aware that the very
possession of that awful weapon of mine was dangerous; merely to have
it might be to use it; but the question is one of your resolve, and I
was fully resolved. My job had to be done, or (as I still dared in
certain moments to hope) not to be done; but if it was to be done, it
was going to be done thoroughly. My neck was not going into a noose
because of other people's blindness. It was of no use talking to Miss
Angela.</p>

<p>And that being so, I abandoned my attempt with her. I smiled.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps you're right," I said. "When one is in love oneself,
and looking forward&mdash;well, perhaps it does bring it home to one.
Perhaps it makes one a little of a busybody. So," I concluded, "I hope
you won't exaggerate what I've been saying."</p>

<p>And a few minutes' further talk of things she had actually seen for
herself in Archie&mdash;such things as his slight intemperance on the night
of the birthday-party&mdash;made me quite safe with Miss Angela also.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>To Kitty I was able to say even less than this. Indeed, she now
detested Archie so thoroughly that I was scarcely able to say anything
at all. And, looking back with all the care I am master of, I cannot
see that anything I did say could have been the cause of that
extraordinary breaking off with me without a word.</p>

<p>To Evie I said nothing at all.</p>

<p>There remained one more attempt with himself.</p>

<p>The time I chose for this was fixed by the exigencies of all the
circumstances. I would have wrestled with him for the whole of the two
days that remained before his wedding, but his own absence for a day
precluded this. And as during that day I sought him in vain, I
thought, very wearily, that he must now take his chance. Therefore,
when it came to the very last day, the day before his wedding, I
recognised that that also gave a perfect touch to the Evidence. The
<i>very</i> eve of his wedding.</p>

<p><i>Several</i> evenings before would somehow have been less plausible.</p>

<p>As I walked to his rooms that night I carried with me three things.
Under my arm was my old brown-paper parcel&mdash;for to make a final use of
his bath had seemed to me the most natural excuse for my calling on
him. In my breast pocket I carried that piece of paper that was to be
the Evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> to the world. And in another pocket I had his latch-key,
for which I foresaw a use later in the evening.</p>

<p>I knocked at his door a little after eight, and Jane admitted me. She
gave a familiar look at the parcel that contained my shirt, and also
said something about a box Mr Merridew was leaving behind for the care
of which he wanted me to be responsible. I passed this box on the
first landing. It was locked, but only half addressed&mdash;Archie had not
yet secured the rooms to which he would return with Evie. But he had
not yet said anything about the box to me.</p>

<p>I found him walking about his rooms, taking last peeps into empty
drawers to see whether there was anything he had forgotten. His
packing was finished, and he kept stopping in his prowl to throw
another handful of old letters on to the smouldering heap in his old
Queen Anne teapot of a grate. A little pile of these condemned letters
still remained by the side of his perforated brass fender.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" he cried as I entered. "Just give a squint round, will you,
and tell me if there's anything so big I can't see it. And I say: I've
left a box downstairs; I wonder if you'd look after it for me? I've
told Jane."</p>

<p>"Right!" I said. "Bath ready?"</p>

<p>"All ready. By Jove! how letters do accumulate!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span> You go and scrub
yourself, while I polish this lot off."</p>

<p>I went into his bathroom.</p>

<p>But I did not make use of his bath. Somehow I could not bring myself
to it. I only wanted the bath to be known as my motive for calling. So
I filled it, stood by it for a number of minutes, and then ran the
water off again. I took the same brown-paper parcel with me into his
sitting-room that I had brought out.</p>

<p>I did not stay long after that. I was coming back. At nine I rose.</p>

<p>"What, are you off?" he said. "I must say you take what you want and
clear off pretty quick! Supper'll be up presently."</p>

<p>"A last stag-party?" I said. "I'm afraid you'll have to have it
without me. I've got to get to Bedford yet. So," I added, "I shall
have to wish you&mdash;you know&mdash;get it over now."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't put on so much blessed ceremony!" he said. "It isn't as if
you weren't going to see me again!"</p>

<p>It wasn't.</p>

<p>"Oh, about that box," I said. "Better call Jane, and tell me in her
presence."</p>

<p>"Well, if you <i>will</i> leave me to eat my last bachelor supper alone.
But I should have had to clear out myself just after. Got to have a
word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> with Aunt Angela&mdash;she let's me call her that now."</p>

<p>He moved towards the door.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" I asked.</p>

<p>"To call Jane," he replied. "Bell's busted now&mdash;time I cleared out of
here&mdash;whole place is coming to pieces.... Jane! Ja&mdash;ne!" he shouted
down the well of the stairs.</p>

<p>Then as Jane didn't hear he descended to the floor below.</p>

<p>His old red woollen bell-rope lay in a heap on the floor. That also
had happened as a result of my studies in the British Museum. I busied
myself with it.... By the time he had returned I had made it quite
ready and was gazing thoughtfully into his fireplace.</p>

<p>I went downstairs with Jane, who herself closed the door behind me. I
gave her a very express good-night.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" >

<p>The remainder of that evening I can divide into four distinct stages,
and I will adopt that course, taking them numerically.</p>

<p>The first stage was one of an almost overwhelming lassitude. I had an
hour and a half and more to kill, and this lassitude came upon me
suddenly as I walked slowly in the direction of Cheapside. I was in
its power before I recognised its dangers. The man of action had
suddenly sunk into abeyance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span> with me, and, now that all was ready, all
interest in my job had departed from me. The drudgery of actual
performance was all at once beyond my powers. I could have gone on
planning&mdash;I wished there had been more to plan&mdash;but now to carry
out....</p>

<p>I collapsed suddenly.</p>

<p>Why (I asked myself wearily) trouble after all! Why trouble about
anything? Life was short, yet already too long; its activities
overlauded, its glories contemptibly little; why waste it in
striving&mdash;nay, why live it all? Thirty years of it had brought me
nothing; whatever another thirty years might bring me I should have to
leave, and what would it matter after that whether I left much or
little? Nay, were there really an Infinite Mercy to be "squared," it
was perhaps better to cast myself before it helpless, naked, and
without profit of my life. Why not end it all now? Why not kill, not
Archie, but myself?</p>

<p>I turned with bowed head down the Minories, and something within me&mdash;I
think it was that honest and beaten and bloody-minded
Jeffries&mdash;whispered "The River!"</p>

<p>Presently I stood not far from the Tower, looking over a parapet into
the dark water.</p>

<p>Yes, the river would settle it, that was the real way out. No more
Agency clerkships and red-and-green-lighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span> apartments and sham
betrothals on the other side of that parapet. And no more
heartrending strivings to be free of the circumstances into which the
world malignantly thrust me back the moment I raised my head.
Striving? I realised all my striving in the past&mdash;Rixon Tebb &amp;
Masters', the Method examination, my commissionaireship, the wanton
slander, my late perfected plan&mdash;and the thought that the years to
come might be but repetitions of all this hit me like a hammer. I
could not face it.</p>

<p>Then a detached sentence from one of the books I had read in the
museum sprang up in my mind, and I started a little. The sentence was
to the effect that a man who leaps into water always removes his hat
before doing so. I did not remember that I had taken my own hat off,
but there it lay, on the parapet, at my elbow.</p>

<p>Then, "Well, it will do to cover some other poor devil's head,"
murmured that tired Jeffries, "Get it over, and send that
conscienceless young scamp to hell with <i>your</i> blood on his head.
Somebody always pays, you know."</p>

<p>I removed my coat.</p>

<p>But that tired Jeffries never spoke unanswered, and these words were
answerable. To make a hole in the water from sheer weariness was one
thing, but to destroy myself to compass another's damnation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span> was quite
a different one. The other Jeffries spoke.</p>

<p>"Why should you kill yourself for his sin? Each man must bear his own.
Nay, it is not committed yet and will not be if you are strong and
play the man. Are you going to fold your hands and allow Evie...."</p>

<p>And at the thought of Evie I felt my sluggish blood creep again.</p>

<p>"You live in a practical world&mdash;be practical," continued that satanic
James Herbert. "Prevention is better than cure. Even could he be
punished afterwards, how much better off would <i>she</i> be ... <i>then</i>?
What right have you to bring this horror on her? He's selfish,
ignorant, cruel&mdash;it would be dreadful at the best; but ... oh, think,
man! Think of her now ... and to-morrow!"</p>

<p>"You only want her yourself," growled the other.</p>

<p>"You do&mdash;but that's not your motive!" cried the first. "You've
overlooked all he's done to you&mdash;but this isn't to you! Coward&mdash;if you
allow it! You won't allow it&mdash;to kill him would be better than to
allow it.... Come; what time is it? She'll be preparing for bed by the
time you get there."</p>

<p>I put on my hat and coat again.</p>

<p>This was my first stage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>The second began with my approach to Woburn Place.</p>

<p>The sitting-room with the pink-shaded lamp lay at the front of the
house, but Evie and her aunt slept at the back. The sitting-room was
in darkness as I passed. I took a side street, and then a back cartway
used by tradesmen. A high wall was in front of me, but by stepping
back I could see the hinder part of the row&mdash;landing windows, bathroom
windows, tiny conservatories, bedrooms&mdash;various oblongs at different
levels, some blinded, some with lamps, many in darkness. Behind me was
a mews, with horses that moved their feet in their litter and dragged
at chains from time to time.</p>

<p>The tradesmen's entrances were unnumbered, and I do not know whether I
hit on the right house; but that did not matter. I have mentioned my
uncommon powers of mental visualisation, and these sufficed me. I
fixed my eyes on a window; it might or might not have been Evie's; but
to all intents and purposes it was. Somebody was retiring there, and
the blind was lowered.</p>

<p>I saw no hand, no shadow on the blind. Only the light went out
suddenly, and from the sound the blind made as it went up I judged it
to be a spring blind. A piano had begun to play somewhere, but save
for that all was silent.</p>

<p>It was the last of her single days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>To-morrow.</p>

<p>My heart was hideously alive again. What! Fold my hands&mdash;drown&mdash;and
Evie as she still was up there.</p>

<p>Soft and terrible ejaculations began to break from my lips.</p>

<p>"Ah, would he? Would he? He would, would he?"</p>

<p>A clock struck half-past eleven.</p>

<p>This was my second stage.</p>

<p>I will begin the third at the moment when I pushed gently at the gate
over the whitewashed area near the Foundling Hospital.</p>

<p>His light still showed over the leads, but the basement was in
darkness. Evidently Jane had gone to bed. I felt in my pocket for his
latchkey, mounted the three steps, and with infinite softness put the
key into the lock and turned it. The door opened noiselessly, and I
prevented the click as I closed it again by letting the little brass
knob gently back with my thumb. Then silently I began to mount his
stairs, passing on the way the locked box that had been put into my
charge. I reached the top. The first sound I had made since entering
the house was my tap at Archie's door.</p>

<p>"Come in!" his tenor voice called from behind the door.</p>

<p>I entered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>At first he did not seem more than ordinarily surprised to see me; it
was only after a moment that the oddness struck him.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" he began, in natural though not altogether cordial tones....
Then, "Hallo! I thought you were in Bedford by this time."</p>

<p>"Missed my train," I said.</p>

<p>He stared mistrustfully....</p>

<p>He had been preparing for bed. He had removed his collar and tie, and
his red waistcoat was unbuttoned. Through the chink of his bedroom
door I saw the light of his second lamp.</p>

<p>In his surprise at seeing me back again, he had half risen from his
arm-chair. He remained, his hands on the arms of it, neither sitting
nor standing, as he asked suddenly, "Who let you in?"</p>

<p>"Myself," I answered, in an even tone. "A little unceremonious,
perhaps, but I knew Jane had gone to bed and didn't want to fetch you
down. The fact is, I've found your latchkey."</p>

<p>"You've found my latchkey!"</p>

<p>"In my coat pocket. Don't ask me how it got there. Our two coats were
hanging together one night, but even then I don't quite see.... Here
it is anyway."</p>

<p>I put it on the table.</p>

<p>"That's a rum 'un," he said, slowly sitting down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span> in his chair again,
but keeping his eyes on mine. "So you came back to give it me?"</p>

<p>"I came back to give it you. Besides," my eyes were on his slender
bare neck, "since I was coming back&mdash;I thought I'd like another word
with you before&mdash;&mdash;" I paused.</p>

<p>For a moment I could not understand the readiness with which he took
up the thing I had not said. His lips had compressed a little.</p>

<p>"Ah! Again?" he said, with a little kindling in his eyes.</p>

<p>"'Again'?" Then I saw. He had seen Miss Angela during the last hour,
and she had doubtless spoken of my own call on her. "Yes, again," I
answered.</p>

<p>That third stage had a curious close. That close was nothing less than
the reunification of those two halves of the Giant to the fabulous
splitting into two of whom I have likened my mental state. They came
together again, these two halves, as the two forces come together that
make the thunder clap ... but of this in a moment.</p>

<p>After several moments of increasingly rapid talk, we were both
standing, he defiantly with one hand on the edge of the mantelpiece, I
at the other end of the hearth. He had risen a moment before at
certain words of mine, as if to inform me that our interview was over.
Once I had seen his eyes move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span> towards the place where the bell-rope
should have been, but that lay, a red woollen heap, on the floor
behind me, and he would have had to pass me in order to get into his
bedroom. He had found an appearance of forcefulness in the use of
violent words.</p>

<p>"Why, damn your impudence!" he blustered. "Look here, my good man! If
you suppose I'm going to be talked to like this by you or anybody
else&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then deny the fact," I said for the fifth time.</p>

<p>"I'll not deny or anything else till I know what right&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know it comes late, but I've spoken of it before."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;sneaking behind my back!" he said hotly, probably again
remembering his recent conversation with Miss Angela.</p>

<p>"To your face."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and if it hadn't been for something else I should have told you
then what an interfering devil you were!"</p>

<p>"Merridew," I said slowly, "it's the last time."</p>

<p>He sneered.</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that&mdash;and confound you for a meddler!" he cried. "If
that's all you came for, get out, and I'll get somebody else to look
after my trunk!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p>We were silent for a space, and in that space I heard the voice of
that human Jeffries, almost pitifully seeking still to save him. "Give
him every chance," sobbed that Jeffries, "he's only a weakling&mdash;you
could crush him mentally as you could physically&mdash;it would be little
better than infanticide&mdash;try him again&mdash;show him that red thing on the
floor&mdash;and that carved thing on the door."</p>

<p>But now Archie in his turn seemed to have become divided. He had
suddenly turned white. But an habitual pertness still persisted in his
tongue. I don't think this had any relation whatever to the physical
peril he seemed at last to have realised he was in. I stood over him
huge and black as Fate.... "Spare him if you can," that generous
bloodthirsty devil in me muttered quickly.</p>

<p>"Merridew," I said heavily, "you'll disappear to-morrow morning ...
<i>or</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shall I?" he bragged falteringly....</p>

<p>"And you won't come back. I shall stay here to-night and put you into
the train myself."</p>

<p>"Then you'll have to sleep in the bath&mdash;and you should know by this
time how small that is," came from his lips.</p>

<p>And yet it came only from his lips. His terrified heart had no part in
it. His only chance now was to have screamed aloud.</p>

<p>But he did not scream. Instead, he stooped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span> swiftly, caught up the
poker, and struck at my head with it.</p>

<p>It was then that the thunder-clap came, and that I was James Herbert
Jeffries, whole, and a murderer. Swiftly as Archie and I came together
the halves of that Giant came together. Instinctively I had guarded my
head, perhaps realising&mdash;I cannot say&mdash;that a single drop of blood
might mean for me precisely what I intended to do to him; but it
mattered little whether blood blinded my eyes or not. Another redness
gorged me, and then, my mind became whitely blind. As colours are lost
on a disc that revolves, so all my plans and preparations spun and
mingled. All was there, yet nothing was there. For an instant my
visual memories of that pleasant, dimity-papered apartment stood
separate; my own old experiences and new divinations also stood
separate; I saw ahead, three or four minutes ahead, his struggles in
my great arms, my left arm about his ankles, my right hand over his
mouth, the red of the woollen bell-rope against his white neck ... and
then all wheeled hideously together....</p>

<p>I was upon him, smothering him with my bulk, and wondering even as I
bore him backwards to the door whether I myself was bleeding....</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" >

<p>The fourth stage was characterised throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span> by an extraordinary
quietness. There was the light sound of the turning of paper in it,
for I had to search in a pile of old books and papers for his
shorthand pad and to make sure I had the right one&mdash;I had to take from
my breast pocket another sheet of paper and to glance at that also to
make sure that it also was the right one&mdash;and then I had to approach
the bedroom door and to drop this into his pocket....</p>

<p>But before I did any of these things I tiptoed to the mirror over the
mantelpiece in order to see whether I bled.</p>

<p>I did not. My left eye was of a dull red, but not with blood, and I
could deal with that. As a preparation for dealing with it I emptied
at a draught the brandy flask he had prepared for his journey on the
morrow.</p>

<p>Softly as a cat I continued to move about.</p>

<p>Then I had to remember which of his stairs creaked to the tread. They
were the fourth and the tenth from the first landing; I knew that as
well as I knew my own name; and yet for a time I really could not
remember the numbers.</p>

<p>The room was quiet as a grave as I gave a final glance round at the
displayed Evidence....</p>

<p>Then behind his Queen Anne grate a cricket began to sing.</p>

<p>Nobody saw me leave the house. I had to bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> his latchkey away.
Without it the latch would have clicked as I closed the door from the
outside.</p>

<p>Then I crossed Mecklenburgh Square and walked towards King's Cross.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later an apparently very drunken man of uncommon
stature lurched heavily through the swing doors of my public-house and
fell full length on the floor in the middle of a knot of drinkers. A
barman dived quickly under the flap of the counter, with an "Outside!"
rushed towards me. I was hauled to my feet. I had a hand over one eye.</p>

<p>"<i>'E's</i> copped the brewer all right!" a cheerful voice sounded in my
ear. "Just smell 'im! Must ha' been drinking it straight out o' the
cask."</p>

<p>"'Ere&mdash;'old 'ard&mdash;ain't it your lodger?" somebody else said suddenly.</p>

<p>"Is it? Lumme, so it is! Look at 'is eye!"</p>

<p>"Ain't 'alf a mouse!"</p>

<p>"'Ere, 'elp me up with 'im the back way, Jim&mdash;Lord! 'e weighs a ton!
I've never known 'im 'ave a drink 'ere, but there, they get it at one
place if they don't at another."</p>

<p>Then somebody bawled to me:</p>

<p>"Look out&mdash;don't blow your nose&mdash;you'll 'ave your eye up if you do!"</p>

<p>But I wanted my eye "up." Up it came instantly, large as an egg, and
there was a laugh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, 'e won't brag much about where 'e got <i>that</i>!" somebody said.</p>

<p>And they helped me up to my red-and-green-lighted room.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" >

<p>They say somebody always pays. Well, this my story. It is a long time
ago, and nobody has paid yet. Nor, as far as I can see, is it likely
that anybody ever will. There is only one detail that I have not been
able properly to attend to, and even that has attended to itself&mdash;for
of course Kitty Windus fled because she realised that I was in love
with Evie. I could hardly expect her to stay after that.</p>

<p>No: nobody has paid. Nobody ever will.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
